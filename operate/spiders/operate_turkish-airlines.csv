nan,Economy Class,2.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Kinshasa to Brussels via Istanbul,1.0," |  Kinshasa to Brussels via Istanbul. I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm -  it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet. Never have I seen such disorganization, lack of communication and disdain for customers. And with all that, they don't even bother to send an apology email, or offer compensation -  nothing! Dont fly them!! They used to be good, but clearly not anymore.",Business,1.0,nan

I lost connection flight and the help desk at Istanbul airport disrespect and poor management and care of passengers . They didn’t provide hotel for delayed flight of one day.

A330-300,Economy Class,5.0,January 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Bangkok to Istanbul,5.0," |  Bangkok to Istanbul. Check in and Boarding at BKK was smooth. A330-300 was modern clean and with smooth lighting. The 2-4-2 layout is friendly and nobody has more than 1 seat to the aisle. The seat was comfortable with nice leg room and recline. Cabin crews were polite and friendly and served immediately after the seat belt sign was turn off. First service aperitif with peanut, drinks and meal menu to passengers follow by the tasty late lunch (2 choices) were delicious and the portions were satisfactory with full choice of drinks. After the main service crews provided bottle of water. IFE works very well with more than 250 films in almost every languages including Thai. During the flight crew came often with drinks or ice creams and before landing crews served dinner. All in all,TK offers a solid economy class product.",Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0

I received a confirmation email from the Turkish airline. Few days later I received another email saying that my flight has been changed. I looked at my reservation online I did not see any changes. I ignored it. What I did not know and they never mentioned it, is that when something like this happens. the Turkish airline will not allow you to check in online and you need to come to a Turkish airline counter at the airport to manually check in. I arrived one hour before my flight at the Turkish airline counter and no one was there. I tried all possible ways to resolve the issue with the Turkish airline but no help was offered. I had to buy another ticket on a different airline. I will not use Turkish airline anymore and my advice to anyone else try to avoid them at any cost.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
A320,Business Class,4.0,July 2018,1.0,4.0,nan,yes,Istanbul to Madrid,4.0," | Istanbul to Madrid. I quite like Turkish Airlines and have flown them extensively throughout the world, in both economy and in the no-longer-existent Comfort Class. This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock. The entrée was very poor quality, tasteless, and cheap. It cost me a lot of miles and a lot of euros to take this flight; this is the first time Turkish has disappointed me and on the first time flying Business Class. I think Do & Co and Turkish should be ashamed of this offering.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Such uncomfortable seats and the most bizarre changeover of staff at Entebbe in the middle of the night - no idea that would happen and we had a host of cleaners on board with hoovers. No sleep possible. On the flight for two hours and no offer of a drink. Miserable unfriendly crew. I won’t travel Turkish again.,Business,2.0,2.0

The plane, crew, service on board, ground staff and food were excellent in economy class. We were given blankets, pillows, a travel kit with mask, sandals, socks, camo, hot towels, also the leg room was very good. Because our connection was long we did a free Tour in Istanbul which was very cool. I would definitely travel again on Turkish Airlines.",Family Leisure,5.0,2.0

When I arrived to Ankara airport my luggage did not appeared on the belt and I then consulted to lost luggage desk. The guy working there told me that he can see my luggage is in Istanbul and they will send it to my address tomorrow. he even told me that they have received an email for my luggage already. The next day nothing happened and I called them. Quite surprisingly I found out that they know nothing about the luggage they even don't know in which country is my luggage at the moment, meaning the THY assistant on the desk lied to me in a very professional way. I has been couple of days now and heard nothing. No one is contacted - besides I then saw the report that the initial guy wrote, the color of my luggage was written wrong and the flight number I took was completely wrong. I wish there would be better options then them so no one would feel they have no other choice.",Business,1.0,1.0

I reserved a double seat 100 days prior to the flight. Checked In with the same seat selection as soon as online check in started. However when we reached the airport the staff tells us that there are no double seats on the flight and gave us a seat near the emergency exit. To our surprise we found that there are double seats on the flight. And the so called extra leg space seats are infact the most uncomfortable seats you can have. This kind of blatant lies on part of the Turkish Airlines staff is completely unacceptable.,Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
Boeing 777,Business Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,no,Manila to Istanbul,3.0," |  Manila to Istanbul. I was hoping the return flight would be better that the outbound, Istanbul to Manila. I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Business Class,2.0,May 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,Dublin to Tel Aviv via Istanbul,2.0," |  Dublin to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines fall short in all areas from customer service to cabin and inflight experience. The lounge they use at Dublin is the worst experience. No recognition of business class passengers - we pay for this experience, but it is non existent. Narrowbody business class seating not overly comfortable, especially when in the recline position, especially the leg rest or lack of leg rest. Poor in flight service, feeling of being a burden to the cabin staff, despite only 50% occupation on business class cabin. IFE screen malfunction, poor response from crew and no offer of seat change.  Not worth the extra fare for business class as there was a total lack of experience. I submitted feedback and received a response from them that did not address the basis of the feedback.",Business,1.0,nan
A330-300 / Boeing 777,Business Class,4.0,July 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Bangkok to London via Istanbul,4.0," |  Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR. The process of getting PED's was almost as cumbersome as getting them checked in but TK staff did their best to return devices as quickly as possible.",Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0
nan,Economy Class,3.0,June 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,no,Beijing to Atlanta via Istanbul,5.0," |  Beijing to Atlanta via Istanbul. The flight itself was very good. My issue is with the mediocre to bad service outside of the flight. I purchased an economy ticket and tried to use my miles (from another airline within Star Alliance) to upgrade one segment of the flight. Simple? Not at all. I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me. Then they tried to charge me a reissuing fee for their mistake. Then I tried to upgrade again and couldn't online so I contacted them (this time by phone) and was told that their system was down and they couldn't do anything.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

The outbound trip from Bahrain to Istanbul came on a date that was critical (28 Jun 2016 and what happened in Istanbul Airport). The airline and airport services worked professionally to cope with the stress around, rescheduling flight cancellations and assigning delayed people to new flights, others have been taken to hotels. I was travelling with my family, everything was arranged smoothly and since we got delayed for the flight of the next morning, we were offered a 5 star hotel accommodation and a Business class upgrade for the connecting flight to Tunis.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,1.0,July 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul,1.0," |  Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul. They charge for sporting equipment stating it's a 'handling fee'. They are happy to take golf bags and skis free of charge, and diving equipment to three destinations free of charge, but the rest of the world they charge for. It really can't be that hard to handle some fins, a mask and a very small speargun for no charge can it, especially when these make up the only form of checked in baggage? And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Longer trip time (10.5 hours) from the reverse trip (Istanbul to Seoul) though the present voyage is anti-clock wise i.e. you earn some distance from earth's clockwise rotation. Same flight from Istanbul to Seoul was 9.5 hrs. Insufficient cleanliness of the cabin. Normal service. Food variety short. Seats on both flights had small space with front seat, knees were stuck on front seat for a medium size man (1.75 height).",Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0
A330 / B777,Business Class,5.0,June 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes,London to Guangzhou via Istanbul,4.0," |  London to Guangzhou via Istanbul. I chose Turkish Airline on this occasion instead of my regular Qatar Airways. Was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turn out to be, flights were punctual, priority boarding at all sectors, attentive and smiling FAs plus a chef on board preparing food which was very tasty and flatbed seats on both aircraft. The only issue, nothing to do with the airline, is the last leg, Istanbul to London and it can be daunting especially after a 10 hour flight where you go through security checks twice and no laptops on hand baggage. Although flying Business Class, the queues is very much the same as travelling economy and it took forever. Apart from the security checks at IST, everything else was as good if not better than some other 5* airlines I have flown. Give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",Business,5.0,5.0
nan,Business Class,1.0,June 2017,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes,Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul,5.0," |  Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul. The arrival experience could be stepped up slightly. There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members.  The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board.  Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals. I have flown with them a few times and nothing has been on show or shown in the menu.",Business,4.0,5.0
A330-300,Business Class,4.0,June 2017,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes,London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul,5.0," | Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as “salad and steak” it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less. Overall a good flight, worth recommending if the price point is right.",Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0

We waited in the queue for 25 minutes to find out that we had been standing in the wrong queue, as there were two flights to Istanbul that day at similar times. We came to the check-in counter when the lady informed us that we are at the wrong counter and we are too late and check-in is already over. She then directed us to the Turkish Airline counter but he told us that he cannot help us. We pointed out that we only have two small carry-on bags and all we need is a boarding pass (and we still had 50 minutes to departure). He refused with a smirk adding that that's not his problem.  We ended up spending thousands of Euros for our new tickets, paying for a hotel, and changing the schedule of our trip and all of it was unnecessary.

The check in was efficient and fast, there was a special clearance lane for Turkish Airlines passengers (different to the normal fast track for other airlines and this lane fed straight into the lounge). The plane was a little late taking off and there seemed to be no hurry with the meal service, a pity as I would rather have slept straight away and just had breakfast. The food and wine on the plane was good. The bed was comfortable and I slept well.

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue. Felt much more comfortable on the 10+ hour Istanbul to Boston leg with my back-pack stored above me rather than under the seat in front of me.

But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city. Bottom line, best customer service I have ever had. Keep doing what you are doing Turkish Airlines!",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment. ",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

Found the Business Class check-in tucked away in the corner of a seething departure hall. Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted! We were taken by bus to the domestic terminal and all in all 30 minutes delay. I have not had a delayed Turkish Airlines flight for months so not a big deal for me.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

We had US Dollars in cash but there was no system at Istanbul airport to pay for E-Visa in cash. This resulted us spending 24 hours at airport with family and 1 year old baby.

The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA’s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (“Devon”). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze – I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles.

I went to see the station manager, had to repack stuff whereafter she once sgain said it was too much. Another trip to station manager and with some dont do it again words he let me go.

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row  in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board.

Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again.

Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more.  No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid.  When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright. We just did not understand why on a night flight it took so long to get your meal after the take off.

You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight. All in all, very happy with the airline, their call center (which I used to reserve my seats) and would gladly fly with them again. .",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn’t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays.

The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley.

I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.",Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0

Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route. This was despite vacant air bridges. Overall it was a good experience but TK has to reverse the downward trend in their catering quality and return to the high standards they used to have.",Business,3.0,3.0

Very professional crew, elegant and efficient and amazingly cheerful, captain announcements was very pleasant. Although planned for 1h 45 duration, the flight lasted a short 1h20 minutes.

That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce.  We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly? ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

The catering on board is suffering from bean counter recommendations. Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly.

Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit, yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx, seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus (I would not have liked to be first on the bus) to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane.

She spent 8 hours in the airport, from 7pm till 3am, was inside the plane for 1,5 hour and then got kicked out with everyone else. No one offered any complementary food, water wasn’t given. Somehow at 3:30 am they provided the hotel, but she had to share it with the other 2 passengers not related to each other. The transport wasn’t provided, so she had to pay for taxi from her own. By 11 am the hotel told them to check out. She left hotel and took taxi back to the airport. Only business class was take care of. We spent another 5 hours in the airport waiting for some news. At 5 pm they opened check in for another flight.  After all this long upsetting time the new flight got delayed again! For another 1,5 hours.

Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases.

Check-in was relatively painless considering it was at a very early hour of the morning. Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue.

The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then; the documents, which we have requested from you before, will be forwarded to our Claims department in order for assessment. We would like to thank you for your kind understanding, regarding such period, in advance."". I replied, asked what time frame, what ""period"" we're talking about here, given that the 5 days are over. I got the same canned response. I arrived 13 days ago, I received not 1 comment on my missing bag from Turkish Airlines. They ignored the problem so far. They are opaque about the process, share neither procedures nor timelines/schedules. I'm sitting in Singapore without my things and this airline just doesn't care at all. They claim to be oh-so-customer friendly - and truth is, their service in the air was good. But I sincerely hope that no one ever has to talk to them about lost baggage, because here they are terrible and fail in every customer service metric you can come up with. ",Business,1.0,nan

My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use “old version” or “new version” I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of – why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn’t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there’s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern.

There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0

There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time.

On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached  the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.

They have no idea about seat layout of aircraft and nobody don't accept and try to solve any kind of problem.

When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldn’t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before take-off given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After take-off breakfast was served. I had ordered scrambled eggs but when they reached me in row Four, they said they had all gone. They offered an omelette or waffles; the latter not being on the menu. After breakfast I made up my bed and slept for hours. We had been asked for our lunch selection from the menu. Cabin was crowded - must have been full or close to it. During the night I went to the toilet. The flight deck door was wide open and it looked crowded in there too with some crew standing. In the morning they started the lunch service. In front of me I heard a lady complain and say “But I ordered it.” When they reached me they said they didn’t have the steak I had asked for. I could have the other menu options or a beef stew option which also was not in the menu. I guess the lady had also been disappointed about steak. Landed about 30 minutes early and taken by bus to the terminal - special bus for Business Class passengers. After customs I went to the arrival lounge but it was closed. In fact I have often found it closed recently. Overall, very good flight. On time. But seems you need to sit in the first couple of rows to be sure of meal choice when flight is full, as they only serve from the front in Business Class.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0

My daughter passed through the gate (204) and was about to board the plane when I was withheld due to the boarding gate having been changed. The fact that my daughter was let through to the plane shows a lack of security by the ground crew at the gate, which is not acceptable. Then we were informed to proceed to gate 306.

No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isn’t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot’s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly.

Now I am told that I can get a ""refund"" after cancellation and ""no-show"" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket.

It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: “Reissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn’t see was the fine print at the bottom: “Turkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.”. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn’t. I don’t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered “I can’t accept this”. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day.

The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs!

Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care.

And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight.

But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey.

The service of the crew was excellent. My mother in law who was traveling with us can only consume liquids and requested if she could could get some milk to drink. Instead the crew brought her soup from business class and then came back a little bit later with some more. Truly above and beyond service on their part. The only thing though is the USB ports did not fully work in all of the seats which was annoying, and I wish they did not do away with the delicious Turkish food which used to be served. But all in all Turkish Airlines is worth every penny, and I do not regret choosing them back in 2007 as my international airline of choice.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0

As the carry on exceeded the 8 kilos permitted cabin weight, I paid the extra fee and checked in the carry on as well. However, when landed in Tehran, I realized that the carry on's tagging number was not even issued at the boarding desk and my carry on was lost. I filled in the application form at lost and found office in Tehran and have called the Turkish airlines at Munich airport several times so far, but after 10 days still haven't received any answer. As I do not even have a baggage tag number for my carry on, I cannot even claim for compensation. What I am wondering is, even if the check-in clerk forgets to hand over the baggage tag, why can't they try to check what was the number of the checked in carry-on as all the information are recorded and kept in the system.

I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff don’t even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets.

Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that “No request can be traced at their hotel desk on IST”. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST.

After visiting several counters, waiting for hours, I was given new boarding card for a flight 24 hours later. They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight.

I can not understand how it can be possible in such a competitive climate to be as inefficient and unreliable. There were no personnel from the airlines waiting for me in Istanbul on either journeys (to and back from Singapore to Kosice).

Check-in was very quick at ORD airport with kind and very polite agent. Boarding was in order and a separate boarding line for Business class and Elite members. On board was greeted with a warm welcome. Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML (Asian vegetarian meal). I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is, that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying. I suggest they should improve this. Again I will be flying on TK business class end of March this year.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Food and drink service was amazing, we were first handed packs of peanut followed by a drink service, then dinner. The food was really good, and was filling for one person. Drinks were provided throughout the flight. IFE was good, and there were plenty of films and series. One complaint is that there were some random episodes of some TV Series (like Season 4 Episode 5-6-7 of a series). Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights I've taken, they were able to have an actual conversation in English.

I took with my partner on the 17 January 2018 at 19:00 a Turkish airline flight from Napoli  to Perth  with connection flight in Istanbul and Kuala Lumpur. The flight left the city of Napoli 30 min late. Once we landed in Istanbul me and my partner quickly went to check the connection flight time which was also affected by 30 min delay. Once onboard of the flight TK60 of 18 Jan 2018 at 2:25 the plane was not full of passenger yet. At 2:35 the captain announced that we had to wait 15 min for more passenger to arrive that then turned into 45 minutes. We end up leaving at 3:45 and due to this late departure we also had to wait for seven planes to take off before us. On board me and my partner have been asking several times to the staff for the connection flight from Kuala Lumpur but all the cabin crews including the manager seems to don’t know much about the situation and didn’t really care. On late arrival in KL at 18:30 we miss our connecting flight with Malindo airline and ground staff told us we were on next morning flight and that hotel and transports have been arranged. The next day we went back to the airport at 5:30am just to find out that we were not on the flight at 8:45 am and the staff of Malindo knew nothing of our situation.

I would recommend to anyone who can avoid this airline to do so by all means. I cannot find words to describe their ""customer service"" and should anything go wrong during the trip you are left alone. Between booking and flying, TK changed the aircraft type and a flight time without informing me at all. I flew from LHR to IST and then my flight from IST to SKG was cancelled. It took me 2.5 hours at the transfer desk and stories I cannot even describe to get a ticket to return back to London as there was no other flight to my destination until the day after. I had a business class ticket, however when I went to the gate I was told they had overbooked the business class cabin and I would have to be downgraded to economy.

It’s a shame that Turkish Airlines use the Bidvest lounge at CPT because it’s one of those pay-to-enter places that’s stuffed with passengers gorging themselves with food. Boarding for the CPT – IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian décor of shades of grey – no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbour’s legs. Cabin crew use a counter at the front of the cabin to prepare the food and drink service; it’s probably best for that to be done behind the scenes. It was good to have WiFi, even if it was rather slow. The Bentley night bag, Denon noise-cancelling headphones and large-screen IFE with a touch-screen remote were impressive. So, too, was the separate menu card for ordering breakfast in advance. The food service got off to a flying start with LED candles, laying out one’s tray and then the starter options where wheeled past. In principle, one could have as much as one wanted. The meze and mushroom soup were delicious. Less good were the main courses, which were, curiously, both overcooked and barely warm. A trolley of desserts and a cheese plate restored one’s faith in the presence of the on-board chef. Wines were largely Turkish, but the cabin crew seemed clueless about them. The cabin crew in general were efficient but somewhat robotic. Announcements from the cockpit lacked the friendliness of British Airways pilots. Sleep was hindered by the over-hot cabin temperature and being woken three hours before landing for the breakfast service – at 3 a.m. But at least breakfast was a cut above the usual and a feta omelette was actually pleasant. Landing was on time and we were bussed separately to the terminal. The double-level Turkish Airlines CIP lounge is vast, offering 24/7 service, unbelievable square meterage and questionable activities to pass the time. I suspect that if anyone started playing the piano on the dais they’d be asked to desist in case it put the indoor golfers off their stroke. Frankly, it was all too much. For the second leg of IST – LHR, we were on a 777-300 with a 2:3:2 configuration in business class. Thankfully the cabin was less than a third full, so we opted out of a second breakfast and caught up with some sleep. Again, the luxury of a flat bed on a short-haul flight takes some beating.

Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good!

Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge.

To our surprise we were informed that we are not eligible because the rule is that only customers with a wait time 3-7 hours are eligible!

After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked.

I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane.

My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the  airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags.

I was very impressed with the on board product, nice seats with reasonable legroom, very friendly staff, excellent food and also excellent in-flight entertainment. The kids received toys from the stewardess (on both flights) and were happy the entire time. Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of. All in all a very pleasant trip with both departures on time and a solid performance of the airline. We will certainly choose Turkish for our next trip if possible.",Family Leisure,5.0,3.0

Orderly boarding with priority boarding well handled. Inside the aircraft I first noticed the small size of the individual seat-back screens. But obviously airlines can’t just throw them all away when bigger and better ones come along. Hot meal served in flight - with a choice of two entrees and various drinks. Delay landing in Istanbul due to congestion - hopefully a thing of the past when the new airport opens. Bus to the terminal. Long queue for the Biz class immigration desk. To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew. I don’t understand why the crew dont use the two adjacent but always empty Beogs electronic immigration gates, hence freeing up a second line for the high revenue fare paying passengers.

The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation.

It had been a great holiday but the flight out was a real let down. For inexplicable reasons our seats were in a hot zone in the plane and we felt like we were being subjected to some sort of in-flight sauna! We did ask the flight attendant (twice in fact) if she could let the flight engineer know of our discomfort. Nothing changed and our four hour flight was awful (not helped by the fact that my wife already felt under the weather). The staff member to whom we reported the fault appeared genuinely sympathetic but although the rear seats in the plane did get cooler we sweltered the whole trip. I think Turkey's a great place and would like to visit it again - but I will not travel on Turkish airlines again.,nan,2.0,nan

Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful. I certainly will not be flying with them again. TK is no competition for the likes of EK QR or even BA for that matter.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,5.0,nan,5.0,yes,nan,5.0,My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,nan,5.0,nan

But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes.

The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved.

Not sure why they are part of Star Alliance as they don't seem to care about Star Alliance patrons either.

The online booking and check-in was easy the website is very user friendly (no OLCI at Mombasa though). The planes on HEL-IST-HEL were Airbus equipment one older and one new with state-of-the-art entertainment system. The older one had only overhead screens showing flight tracking only. The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered. As all flights were normal I cannot comment how the problem situations are handled. For us the round- trip was perfect and I have no hesitation to use Turkish again.,nan,5.0,nan

Free wireless and live TV (only 4 channels though) clearly made the 14 hours of flying more tolerable. However we didn't have those on the return flight even though it was the same plane- 777-300. Service and catering have been great on both flights. Seat comfort however was below average since it's impossible to sleep with its angle.

Itinerary showed B739 and B773 but ended up flying in B738 and A340. The B738 was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for MAN-IST a 4 hour flight. My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average. Rarely notice any drink rounds on the 10 hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal.

After enquiring they simply took back the meal and served a new one without saying a single word. No apology - nothing. Other questions were answered with grimaces only not words. Safety instructions from staff before landing sound more like army orders. The media box in their A340 takes half of the foot space absolutely inconvenient on long distance. The inflight entertainment doesn't contain new releases only old movies. The schedule as per magazine doesn’t comply with the entertainment system. Furthermore very limited language options on some flights only. The food was very good on one flight average on 2 and un-enjoyable on the 4th flight. Journey time was quite long. Website looks antiquated not possible to order special meal only by phone.

nan,Business Class,2.0,nan,1.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,5.0,Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,nan,4.0,nan

They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat.

Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST. This was delivered on the next flight and delivered by courier the next day.,nan,4.0,nan

Normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this Boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! Also they had no control over the hand luggage. Passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin. When the lockers were full some passengers started arguing. This was chaos! Until this point we had always been satisfied with THY but this time we were disappointed.

However: Online check in is a time consuming and laborious process. It is a completely pointless exercise as we had to queue for almost an hour to have the ground crew re-check us in for the flight and take our bags. Staff both on the ground and in the air were surly and miserable. My seat on the flight from LHR-IST was broken and did not lock in any position which was deeply uncomfortable. On the same flight my partner's TV was broken and did not work at all. It took the flight crew almost 1 hour 40 minutes to serve a drink. Transfer arrangements in Istanbul can only be described as a complete and utter shambles. No clear directions people everywhere being funnelled into a small security check area. On the way home we were told to go and join another random queue for a further passport check. Whilst at the gate in IST the flight to Odessa was delayed by an hour with no staff whatsoever in sight.

B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,nan,4.0,nan

No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago. Beverage service excellent and although staff of THY are not very smiley they were effective. Inflight entertainment good with good selection of movies both older and recently published.

It was an 8.5 hrs flight so me and my wife slept a bit after the meal was done. I took beef biriyani and my wife took grilled chicken. The chicken was really tasty unfortunately I choose the wrong meal. Then before landing we were served a sandwich which was good. On our 2nd leg IST to JFK (10 hrs 30 mins) it was an early morning flight which was supposed to take off at 7.30 but got delayed 45 minutes. First meal (scrambled egg with mushroom) was served immediately after take off which was tasty but the cabin crews were again disappointing.

Completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys. The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,nan,5.0,nan

A321 was dirty and old. The cabin crew served the meal and drinks and disappeared for the entire flight. My headphones stopped working in the middle of the movie and even changing them did not help. Staff did not do anything to help. My next flight to Santiago via Bilbao was as bad as the first one. No movie available. Only one service available during 6 hrs of the flight.

No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,nan,2.0,nan

What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights. Lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board.",nan,4.0,nan

The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy.

IFE maybe the best I've seen and easy to operate. Huge monitors. Bed not fully lie flat so I actually turned around and laid my head on the stool and slept better with my legs in slight upward position. Night-kit given was boring and superfluous. Check-in at transit in JNB only possible 3 hours prior to departure. However was allowed through security without boarding cards as to kill time in the SAA-lounges. When the check in lady eventually appeared at transit she was professional and kind and managed even to trace my luggage and give it an additional (needed) label so I could transfer it throughout. The corresponding luggage receipt was smoothly given to me as I entered the stairs boarding the aircraft. The lounge in IST was extended with a huge under-deck 3 days ago and is a world-class positive experience in design space beauty and service provided. IST-WAW on Airbus 321-200. Not business class seat but ordinary economy with tabled middle seat to increase space in the 3x3 configuration. IFE on small ceiling monitors were useless. Staff were alert and kind. As usual for TK one was dressed up pretending to be a cook despite we were only 4 pax in business out of 12 possible.

Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable. Ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didn't attach the priority label at all.

Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail.

Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served.

I paid for business class and I didn't even get anything near decent economy standard. The plane was old. The seats were in a very bad state. Boarding was chaotic.

For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways.

As a Gold member I am not able to select exit rows either not even at online check-in. On both flights I was comfortable however having an aisle seat the middle sear next to me was empty the cabin was not hot at this time and the service was rather good.

Nobody served water or anything during the night dinner was OK but meagre and as a vegetarian I got only half the food of those who had ordered meat. I asked for more but the staff member never came back with it. The flight could not land in Kathmandu due to fog. We were 5 hours late with an extra landing in New Delhi with no food or drink and arrived 5 hours late with no offer of compensation. On the way back again more than 5 hours delay without information as to why as we arrived in Istanbul it took ages to get tickets for a meal in the airport and when we got them we could only use them in the fast food restaurants in the food court and had to pay ourselves if we wanted to sit in a decent place.

Imagine a delay of 1 hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reason/extent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information. Pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of Turkish Airlines. And there are two extremes: no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated. I'm sure Turkish Airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time. Would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines.

They even brought a menu with a choice of two plates. Wine was free. There even was a cook (complete with a cook hat). I know -it's just a flight attendant dressed differently but I bought it. Being a Gold elite member at Star Alliance I had access to the Turkish Airlines lounge before the flight. Truly wonderful. Spacious a great buffet and even a golf simulator to kill time.

It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight.

However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed.

On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway.

Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over.

Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines.

Roomy seats nice amenities and good food in comfort class. The in flight entertainment was not so great mostly older movies but we slept just fine. We had concerns about the temperature in flight and yes it was too warm. On our return from IST the check in was chaotic at best.

I had to show my ticket stub 4 times to prove I was in the correct area (not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub) and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats.

The staff on the return leg were one of the most hard working I have encountered making up for the poor plane. However the breakfast was served cold and was uneatable. Same meal was served on the IST-LGW leg and we declined it. Security check at IST on the return leg was horrible.

Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front.

Floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor. When I told Flight Attendant I don't believe she really understood. She told me to use the restroom in Business Class but this was in Business Class. Second problem was it seemed families with young children (infants and toddlers) were invited to use Business Class as a free upgrade.

I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available.

Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money.

Never asked me if I would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice I would like. I got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on.

From wait in lounge to designated gate to last call all of this in less than 10 minutes simply ridiculous. Experienced this many time. Once on board all is different - friendly yet professionals staff with lack of language skills but ok on security and service. Some try to go the extra mile. Only option to IST direct. They need to improve ground staff and boarding skills and attitudes otherwise I would perhaps recommend.

By far the best of all European carriers for comfort and privacy. It offers a 2-2 configuration with 20' leather recliners with additional foot rest. There is a personal VOD monitor in the arm rest with a wide variety of shows and movies for a 3 hour flight. Flight attendants are very polite and professional. Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business. Will definitely recommend and travel again in the future.,nan,4.0,nan

The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrée that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,nan,5.0,nan

We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance. Flights were punctual (no delays) and crew were smiling.,nan,5.0,nan

Breakfast was staggered as there was a flying chef who prepares personalized meals according to a menu that you order off in advance - this works in theory not in practice. On my long haul outbound they forgot some ordered items on my way back they lost my menu card all together. Therefore it was only after the passenger next to me finished his breakfast that they even bothered to ask if I wanted to eat anything. They only refill drinks ie coffee upon request. My breakfast of scrambled eggs was extremely watery and undercooked. 3) Seat configuration: A strange 2x3x2 configuration. On my flight out I was in a window seat and did not notice but on the flight back in seat 2E (center seat) realized that one could feel every footstep of people striding by. 4) Toiletries: On my flight back they forgot to give me my toiletry bag I had to ask for it. 5) Fast track service: Depends on airport I guess but at Istanbul the fast track immigration line was not much shorter vs the normal lines. I only flew this airline due to the convenience of transit to my final destination (Tbilisi).,nan,3.0,nan

Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew. Meals: overall two hot meals - tasty and well-presented. IFE completed with a wide range of movies and TV programs. Live TV and free-wifi onboard definitely a plus.

We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights.

IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014.

Oh no given standby seat/pass ran to departure gate sent to aircraft only one seat (we heard staff had been given the seats available). Sent back to another Transit desk from there to the original one where we were re-booked for the next day fortunately checked in and boarding passes printed for us. 4 hours in airport at Istanbul (not a nice experience) before eventually got to hotel. Next day transfer from hotel was late arriving at hotel and little real expectancy of being on flight let alone where the luggage might be also found other UK passengers in same position. Through all check in etc to boarding gate chaos. Why say area A B C etc if not using it. Mad queue load of young kids and parents. On board kids seemed to go to wherever they wanted as did many adults. We got our seats Ok and stayed put. Nightmare for crew many passengers simply refusing to move to allocated seat even though plane was full. I cannot imagine a less organised operation and it seemed this was a regular occurrence and indeed whilst waiting in boarding queue met other UK passengers who had been given STBY cards even though they were at airport very early and had booked several months earlier - it seems the practice to overbook then bump off UK passengers.

Service as usual with THY OK if you don't expect too much the only friendly and smiling stewardess was the one who did not speak any English. Return flight on A321-200 departed on time from VCE and full almost to the last seat. Good for them. Slow food service with only 2 stewards each with one trolley and that took ages mine ran out of beef kebab after the 10th row.

nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,4.0,yes,nan,4.0,I had a short 2-hr flight from Naples to Istanbul before transferring to JFK-NY. It was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about 8 carry-on suitcases. Often you'll be a few spaces short but I've seldom seen that many. I imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the 1 carry-on 1 personal item (which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap) policy. This is negligence on the airlines part. However the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly. They offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a 2-hr flight. The service on the flight from Istanbul to JFK was also quite good. However for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book (at least the system didn't when I tried) so as I result I got stuck in a middle seat which I always try to avoid.,nan,5.0,nan

Cabin crew are cold unfriendly and indifferent to passengers. I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board.

The ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes.

For almost a month from mid-November the Istanbul-Kathmandu sector had never been less than four hours late except for two or three days when it left Istanbul two hours early! On the day we travelled there was a six hour delay meaning we had to wait at Istanbul airport for 10 hours. No excuse or apology was offered. When we eventually boarded they had changed the aircraft from the day before when we had booked our seats online so we found ourselves sitting in seats next to the toilets and with no recline. There was also no IFE. Clearly the aircraft was from another era. An hour after we eventually took off (0200) and when I was finally nodding off to sleep I was rudely awoken by one of the crew and offered breakfast - at 0300! I was also offered wine with breakfast! So it was with some trepidation that I awaited my return journey fully expecting a long delay and wait at Kathmandu Airport which is no pleasure! Fortunately from two days before my departure the flight was running on time. What a different experience. A new(er) plane that had IFE an excellent service from the cabin crew on both flights. Why travellers to Kathmandu were singled out for such delays when nearly all long haul flights are on time remains a mystery. Because of the risk of it happening again I would not fly Turkish Airlines to this destination but otherwise I find them more than acceptable.,nan,4.0,nan

Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held.

However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response.

nan,Business Class,1.0,nan,1.0,nan,4.0,no,nan,4.0,I flew business Dublin to Bangkok via Istanbul. First leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class. The leg from Istanbul to Bangkok was the worst flight I have had. We arrived late into Istanbul from Dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in Istanbul. We eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late. So as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front. We took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice – same as economy. There were 5 airline staff looking after a full business class plus the 2 chefs. The service offered did not reflect. About half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -–not offered a replacement. We were offered a drink I chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm. A short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible. I managed to get 2 glasses of wine from the crew during the meal. Crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and 2.5 hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again. Crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until 2 hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which I had not ordered. There was 1 business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use 80% of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it. There were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet. Finally after disembarking in Bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel I expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the Airport.

Would compare their service to Cathay Pacific. The meal service was outstanding. I've never had meals of this quality before on any airline in First or Business Class.

Drinks were served throughout the trip and were of good quality. The food was of excellent quality for an airline and all in all I really like the feel and modern clean design of the cabin. Seats appeared to be new and were comfortable. I had plenty of room for my knees which was a relief being that I am 6.5 feet tall. In flight entertainment system and film selection is top notch.

Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler!

The seats are not business class and are quite uncomfortable. For the duration of the flight I sat on the pillow. Additionally there was no inflight entertainment.

They are also not picky about a kilo or two overweight which is great. Per pay lounge in Istanbul is free for kids. For $21 you and your children can spend 6 hrs in an all you can eat snack lounge take a shower and recharge. The negatives were: They put me my wife and 3 yr old and 6 yr old daughters in completely separate seats in different rows for the 2nd leg.

Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food.

At check-in in DXB I requested an emergency exit seat for the IST-JFK leg. The rookie check-in agent first said nothing was available but his supervisor stopped by and found one for me. This made the long flight bearable. The flight was packed but the crew were cheerful and efficient and did everything right. Food was so-so - getting a bit weary of the standard kebabs and mystery veggies. The IFE was excellent - far better than Emirates' much touted IFE and better than QR. On the way back was checked in by a surly female agent at JFK. She couldn't find me an exit row on the A-330 to IST but said she found me a bulkhead one on the IST-DXB leg. The A330 was surprisingly comfortable much more so that the 777 even for my 6'3"" frame and the young lady next to me just curled up and slept the whole way through and was no bother to me. On the home leg I found that the seat the JFK agent had got me a seat in the row behind the bulkhead! On the 777 with the seats compressed for the 'short-haul' 4 hour flight to DXB I found sitting was unbearable. I silently cursed this agent and couldn't wait to deplane and get home. Service was once again good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and tasty. But any satisfaction I got from this was neutralized by the uncomfortable seat and the incompetence of the check-in agent at JFK. This is the second time this has happened to me. A year ago flying from AGP-IST-DOH the agent at AGP assured me she had got me an exit row and I found myself directly behind exit row in a non-reclining seat. TK has to train its check-in staff to read the seat map better.

The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,nan,2.0,nan

This is really a shame since hard product of TK is decent but it all falls to the ground with carelessness of passengers. Will definitely try to avoid TK as good as I can.

The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable.

My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,nan,5.0,nan

Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff.

Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs.

In the lounge the agents were working very efficiently to get passengers switched to earlier flights as there were about 25 flights to Istanbul over just a couple of hours and they were helpfully getting passengers away as soon as possible.

Honestly a poor show for an airline that prides itself on its food. AVOD confusing and boring. Could never find the map. The crew spent most of its time standing at the ‘bar’ looking at all of us like we were monkeys in a cage. Really unbelievable.

From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight. Istanbul airport is not at the same level but it's an other story. Safety demonstrations done in all 4 flights general condition of the aircraft's from good to excellent.

Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight.

I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not.

When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing.

Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy!

One very brief announcement from the Captain about weather and that is where the information stopped. No one on board was able to give us any information about missed connecting flights whilst we waited on the tarmac. Plane was full of connecting passengers. Plane then takes off to the correct airport. On arrival there was nobody from Turkish Airlines to process or inform customers of what to do. Eventually we found the transfer desk which had a minimum of 250 people descending on only 4 very harassed and extremely impolite ticket agents. When I finally got to the front the ticket desk agent simply stood up and walked away announcing that it was the end of his shift. Got a new pass for a plane leaving 5 hours later. Still no apology. Just thrown at me as if I should be grateful. Found the business class lounge that was also stuffed to the gunnels at the entry reception and barely a seat available in the place. Summoned to the new gate at far end of the airport. It was a full Airbus 330-300. There was a double security check leading to a seated area that was the size for a small commuter jet flight. 280 or so Passengers were rammed into each other waiting for the coach. There was no Business class fast track. On board staff were the most unfriendly bunch and seemed to have a collapse in their understanding of basic English. One seemed to really struggle with the concept of ""Could I have my lunch a bit later?"" Suffice to say my meal was served with no menu. I was then told that it was either Chicken or Pasta. They forgot to offer me the dessert and I had to chase them for it and was told ""We will see if we have anything left."" Even on disembarkation at the plane of the door they pointedly refused to say goodbye. The main hub is a complete mess and deeply unpleasant experience and the staff on board are feckless and rude.

The next morning due to a miscommunication the Turkish Airlines bus to the terminal was nowhere to be seen at the appointed hours but the hotel shuttle took us ten minutes later. Boarding was by bus to plane parked remotely. Good seating headsets for video screens from ceiling. Showing short videos and mapping of flight. Choice of two hot meals and full bar service on this short 2.5 hour flight. Coffee service too. Meal selected was excellent. Upon return check in was handled by Star Alliance staff at BLQ. Brisk businesslike to the point of being short. Boarding again by bus to plane. Newspapers not passed out. Seating the best of any intraEuropean flight I have been on. So much leg room I had to lean forward quite a bit to eat. No videos nor mapping on this flight. Departure on time and a wonderful smooth flight to IST with another delicious lunch with again full bar service. Flight attendants cheerful and happy. Arrival on time into a gate with air bridge in front of passport control. Overnight again at expense of Turkish. Before boarding we went through six security checkpoints. All but one were friendly and courteous. Airbridge to plane Flight was full. Seat did not seem to recline properly. No newspapers passed out or at entrance. Due to air traffic control delays flight took off one hour late. Entertainment system working fine as well as route mapping. Captain made announcements. There was some gaps in service on this flight. Our section in the cabin was skipped over for hot towels. About 1.5 hours into the flight drinks were offered. No crackers or nuts no napkins. 2.5 hours into the flight lunch arrived at my seat. A delicious chicken meal. Before landing another wonderful hot meal. Landing process at IAD and baggage delivery normal and without problems. I have given this airline nine stars mainly for the great catering and beverages and mostly friendly and efficient staff. Altogether a very good product.

After delay of about half an hour and while the passengers on this full 737-800 were standing for a long time at the new gate, only one staff was taking care of boarding which took a long time and a lot of agony on behalf of passengers to complete.

My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class.

Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST.

This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines – starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips – first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn’t a big surprise – despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time – on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul – one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation – and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members – first to a supervisor in the check in area – who said “no” and that was that. At the care Point – the staff couldn’t care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there’s an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise – Europe’s Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service – caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Family Leisure,2.0,2.0

However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.,Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

Our flight from Munich was delayed over an hour. Turkish Airlines staff didn't make much effort to hurry up the process. After landing at Istanbul, we ran across from one side of the airport to the other side in an effort to catch our connecting flight to Dubai. But by the time we reached the gate about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure the gate was closed and none of airline staff could be seen though they should have known that flights from Munich was delayed. There was absolutely no effort to accomodate the extra few minutes for delay in connecting flights. Next when we contacted Turkish Airlines staff about our next connecting flights, one staff member took our boarding passes for Dubai and disappeared for an hour leaving us at the desk. We tried to find out about our next flight status and other staff members were unwilling to answer us leaving us totally bewildered. Finally after waiting over an hour, our new boarding passes were issued. Finally when we landed at Dubai, our baggage were misplaced though we had specifically asked our baggage so to be transferred to new flight.

Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache. Because of the legislation, when Turkish Airlines is flying in USA, they do have different policy for people with disabilities because in USA you can not discriminate someone because of disability.

Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said “Not my responsibility”. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying “try going upstairs to the transfer desk.” Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which I’ve never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the “not my responsibility” attitude. There was no solution at the “transfer desk”, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told “You need a Turkish visa.” Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didn’t tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me “You didn’t ask. It’s not my responsibility to think for you.” At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldn’t believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was “not Turkish Airlines’ problem” that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didn’t like their solution, I could go to their “supervisor’s desk” at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was “not authorized” to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone. The lady on the help phone was the most helpful out of anyone I had spoken to in a now 5-hour drama, but even she was only able to “make a report”. Long story short, I was forced to pay 178 euros to board the next flight, and when I got to Sofia that night, I saw that Turkish Airlines lost my luggage on top of everything. Three days later, I was informed that Turkish Airlines will not deliver my lost luggage, so I am forced to pay another 100 euros in taxis to get to the airport in Sofia to retrieve my things.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever. Had we known this, I would have had no problem making hotel plans for that night prior to arriving of course but after experiencing this bad service we were then left to find a hotel for the night in a city we had never been to.

When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777.

Turkish Airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than KLM or EL AL in economy.

Despite the fact I purchased business class tickets (not just for this route, but also to and from Turkey), when showing up at check in, they simply said they would downgrade me, because of overbooking. The way they handled the whole situation, kept us waiting for a long time both at check in, and also at boarding, the whole inconvenience was simply terrible experience. They offered a EUR50 check as compensation and thought this would be fair. After returning home, I wrote a complaint for the airline and their reaction is as scandalous as their operations:  ""Concerning the matter you raised in your message, passengers not showing up for their flights cause flights to take place with empty seats. For this reason, as does every airline, Turkish Airlines, too, sells more tickets than the number of seats on the aircraft, from time to time. This situation is called overbooking, and in the case that all the passengers booked show up, some of our passengers unfortunately are unable to fly on the same flight."" Hence they think by explaining me as stupid kid, what overbooking means, they think downgrading is a fair action on their side and that was it. I am a frequent business traveller, this attitude and customer service is outrageous and luckily not everyday routine with other airlines. By the way, same thing happened to fellow travellers also on our way back Bodrum-Istambul-Budapest. Not just they downgraded them because of overbooking (seems to be pretty common with Turkish Airlines) but one of my friends ticket was also deleted from their system. Never heard of anything like this before. When she presented the printed version of her ticket (luckily she had it with her), Turkish Airlines said their system shows that because of overbooking, she was not only downgraded, but also transferred to another flight 1 day earlier than the actual flight. It also showed, that she actually took the flight the day before! This is madness. I have decided never to use Turkish Airlines.",Business,1.0,nan

A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave.

I didn't think that was right and I complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything, without caring even a bit about all those people on the line. The next step was to get a hotel to spend the night, which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out.

VCE-IST was efficient, on time, gate agent fine. Second leg from Istanbul to San Francisco was a delayed departure. I looked around the Turkish Airlines lounge at Istanbul and it is as described, two floors, huge, lots going on, lots of food service. However, if flying Turkish Airlines you are going to get lots of food on the plane anyway so probably most helpful if you are using the lounge when flying nonbiz and have a pass/status. I personally prefer a smaller, quieter lounge but there's definitely the service here. Security for the connection to SFO from IST was heavier, including carry on search/testing and wanding everyone at the gate, so allow plenty of time at the gate. Lie flat seat was excellent, good bedding. I would never want the middle seat in business even with the good seat, and the Turkish Airlines Boeing 777 has middle seats in business class. Food and service very good. Chef only served/dealt with one aisle and FA's did ours; I would recommend alternating maybe by meal.  Someone mentioned less attentive drink service (alcohol) and I actually appreciated less pushing of the alcoholic drinks, and you could get it if you wanted it. It is amazing that in business you could bring two carry on pieces if you want (up to 8 kg each) vs the one + personal item. Overall, Turkish Airlines have some great customer service ideas (chefs, little electric candles for dining, etc.) but probably need to shift a bit more energy to the infrastructure for their growing business.",Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0

The food was excellent and the customer service was okay (I had to beg for a bottle of water when i was dehydrated from being in istanbul too long), but no matter how good the in-flight experience is, nothing defeats the purpose of an international flight more than getting there and finding your luggage didn't arrive with you.

We had some fragile items, which were properly packed, tagged and labeled. In addition to that, we had put on the Turkish Airlines fragile stickers as required by the ground staff. But it never arrived with us to CPH. After investigating, it was told to us that it was not loaded and will arrive next day. But when it arrived, it was not in one piece. One third of the things were broken and there were clear sing of mishandling and wear and tears as the package was scraped. We took pictures of the broken materials and the ripped package instantly in front of the delivery person and sent it to Turkish Airlines. But alas, it was of no use. They ignored our complaint. Not even replying to our email initially. We tried to call to the HQ in Istanbul and then they said they will look into it and later replied that they dont have any responsibility towards it, as it is fragile item so the owner bears the risk of any damage and not the Airlines.

I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people.  I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers.  I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul.  But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it.  The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will.

Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given.

Due to what would be a manageable snow storm elsewhere, we were first kept in the airport with a four hour delay. The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked. The fact that I am an Elite passenger (Star Alliance Gold) made no difference whatsoever. We are still stranded here - no seats available until Wednesday they say.

It was total chaos with lack of communication, poor management, and staff unwilling to provide assistance. It was difficult to find someone who could speak English and when you did, they were rude and condescending. We waited for over 7 hours at the transfer desk to get another flight.

As a business class customer, priority boarding is promised, but at the gate it was a free-for-all. We eventually boarded but due to a computer problem we were delayed at the stand by almost 2 hours. The business class cabin was atrocious. The front of the cabin near the door was soaked in water, due to rain and a leaking sink. The taps in the sink were out of order so we had to rinse hands using bottled drinking water. Seats were economy style, with the middle seat free. When the passenger in front reclined, there was about 6-8 inches of room between the seat and my head, and the leg room was very cramped, knees touching the back of the seat in front once he reclined. There was no IFE, unless you call a sheet of sudoku puzzles entertainment. There were a few drop down screens which were used for the safety video. The screen was so dark it was impossible to see the images. First drink was served in a plastic cup. I am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights, as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute (at the boarding gate). After take off, I waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet. Once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - I can only assume he'd turned it off prematurely and then back on again after I'd walked to the toilet. I sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again. One passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo. I complained to the chief steward who said, he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway. The same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didn't like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane. I also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasn't fit for use. He dismissed my complaint. The leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on, but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides. This is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy (I travelled economy with a group to Kilimanjaro in October - that was a far more pleasant experience, despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering). The lounge at Istanbul is impressive, but be warned, the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience. At Manchester, the Aspire lounge was in need of a good clean. At Kuala Lumpur the Premier Plaza lounge was packed to capacity, with lots of children and seats very close together. Wine is not included in the drinks service. Good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading.

But it was the service and couldn't be bothered that made it so much worse. The level of service at the transfer desk for people who had missed connecting flights was so bad I thought it must be a hidden camera TV show. There were about 500 people in the queue, but only 4 or 5 people working. There was no security and on several occasions fights nearly broke out. This is not surprising as it was the early hours of the morning and people were tired. Any decent airline would have put on extra staff and kept people updated. They would have identified elderly passengers and people with young children and provided them with special service. I was in neither of these categories but would have understood the need. What I would not have understood was why it seemed Turkish passengers able to speak the language were frequently being given special treatment and allowed to jump the line. I was stood in this queue for 4 hours and not once did I see anyone that vaguely looked in charge. It was atrocious. But no one from Turkish Airlines seemed very bothered. Whilst TK might be cheap, you clearly get what you pay for! A lesson learned for me. TK claims to be one of the best airlines in Europe. Under EU law I would be entitled to some compensation I'm sure (even the bad weather can't justify such a terrible delays) but I doubt Turkish Airlines will live up to those standards.

The passengers, including myself did not receive any prior notification from the airline. Considering that many previous flights were cancelled due to weather conditions in Istanbul, the airline had surely predicted delay, but failed to inform the passengers, or make announcements in the airport. No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park. I had already missed my flight to New York (TK 003) which was scheduled for 7:25 on that morning. I understand that sometimes the weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations.

When I finally got out of the plane, we were confronted with a terminal full of stranded, confused, and unorganized passengers. There was no airport or Turkish Airlines Staff to guide us to the correct directions. Naturally we went to the Transfer Desk, to get information on how to get on the next available flight. More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line. Every one was just jammed in front of the counter. There was rarely enough space to breathe or move.  The staff behind the transfer desk were clearly incapable of managing the situation. Instead of managing it, they also lost control and were shouting and banging their fists on the counter!  After 2 hours of standing there, my passport was lost by one of the staff, and I had to wait for another hour for them to find it. Only to find out that all that trouble was for nothing, as I was told to go through passport control and then to the Check-in terminal, and go to Turkish Sales Office. This demonstrates the incapability and poor management of the airline and staff. They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more! I had no other choice, so I followed their advice. The Sales Office line was a nightmare. The line stretched all along the Ataturk Airport check-in Terminal.

I checked my credit card and saw a charge of $824 for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of $3000 for the other 3 tickets purchased. I called the travel web site immediately since I know I am supposed to deal with them first. The rep for the travel web site contacted Turkish Airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors. Nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why. The agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason. However, the reservation agents stated I would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable. Talk about unethical business practice. The airline screws up, cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge, and then charges me almost $4000. I understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel, but how can the airline make that decision without any reason? The Turkish Airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible. Mind you, nobody is saying I will get the situation taken care of. They are only saying I may be able to get the situation taken care of if I talk to the right people. I called Turkish Airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing: IF the situation can be fixed I would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups. When I asked for contact information for the corporate offices I was told to, ""look it up on the Internet and find it on my own."" Awesome customer service - just kidding. I did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed. None of them even put me through to a person. One had me on hold after the automated menu for 15 minutes and cut me off. Another simply had an auto message that stated, ""We cannot take your call. Goodbye."" And the others just rang. Realizing I may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of $3000 went through and a lot of time/red tape I promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation. The credit card company contacted Turkish Airlines and were given the same IFs and MAYs, so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the $824 and promised to block the $3000 or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it.

I left San Francisco on January 1st. Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you. So, here I am, not getting compensation and no one will respond to my emails or talk to me in person. Save yourself a ton of heartache and use a different airline.

The plane from Toronto to Istanbul was a little cramped for legroom, which was a 3x4x3 setting. I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back,  again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice.  Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time. Overall I would say this is a decent airline, not the best. They have one big flaw and that is they are known for delays. I was told even before I flew that be prepared for this, I took this remark with a grain of salt as I know that it happens with all airlines.

It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days. Service on board this time was a lot less as well, IFE was not working or was not there at all, food was not as tasty and it was a very old plane on the leg to and from Addis.

What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office.

(so more than 3 hours before the departure time). The lady who attended me at the check-in counter first gave me the boarding tickets putting me and my family in sequential seats in the same row (51). But before she gave me the boarding tickets, she decided to talk to another attendant and after that she decided to reprint the tickets putting us in totally different seats. Note: one of the passengers was my daughter and she is just 1.5 years old! I tried several times to explain to the check-in lady that I was flying with my daughter and at least the father or the mother must travel together with her – I bought a seat for her just to provide better accommodation and to not bother the other passengers. But she became angry and arrogant, just told me that I would have to solve this “problem” by myself with the gate staff or even with the flight attendants, or even ask people in the airplane to change the seats with me. So in summary the problem was created by Turkish Airlines and I would have to solve it by myself. At that time, I started to be angry with the arrogance and incompetence of the check-in staff, starting with the point that is simply unacceptable to have people working for Turkish Airlines in the International check-in desk who are not fluent in English – without mentioning that they simply ignored the fact that a 1.5 years-old baby would fly alone with the insane arrangement this lady provided me at the check-in desk. Well, still following the instructions gave to me by the check-in lady, two other ladies who were working at the gate simply ignored my requirements. Only after I had to yell to one of that women, she told me (with a very angry face that she could not help me and I would have to solve this problem by myself inside the plane. When the gate was released for embarking, another employee required and took over my tickets and asked me and my family to wait outside the finger. We waited about 20 minutes and when almost all passengers entered into the plane, another employee gave me the tickets back and said that I would have to solve the problem by myself. At that time, I was fed up with the arrogance of  employees who forced me to wait 20 minutes for nothing, and once I entered into the plane I had to start to yell in order to be attended by the chief of flight attendants, who had the courage to propose my wife to hold my daughter in the same seat, giving away to another passenger the extra seat that we bought.

By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay.  Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat.

I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only).

My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation.

Boarding in Mumbai was fine on time. Food (Indian vegeterian) was good, cabin crew were helpful and asked us if we need baby food. Transit in Istanbul is the only worst part (so far) of this airline. Plane doesn't park at aerobridge and you need to take shuttle bus from plane to airport. Walk from airport entry gate to lounge is long. No pram for family travelers. You need to go through a security check before reaching transit area or lounge. Walk from airport gate to lounge is long without enough travelevators and you need to cut across crowd in congested area. Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is excellent - plenty of variety of foods and drink. A nice children play area and changing room. Flight from Istanbul to Dublin was almost empty. Cabin crew suggested us to leave bassinet seat and go to back of the plane and occupy a 3 seater. It was good suggestion, our baby slept peacefully there. Return from Dublin was an issue, at airport all display boards showed flight will depart from gate 307 (?), when we reached there 10 min before gate closure, we didn't see a single staff or notice there. We thought gate closed and everyone left, but wondering how come they closed and left 10 min before schedule closing time. Got panicked. display boards still showing gate #307. In this situation I thought to check with nearby gate staff but it was unmanned - the other adjacent gate was behind a wall. Went there, and boarding was happening at gate 308. But wondered why display boards are showing wrong gate and  if it is wrong gate, then airline's responsibility to put some note, notice at gate #307, so that people don't panic.

Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.

The cabin crew were warm and friendly,  food was quite good for aircraft food, especially if you are a fan of Turkish food. Expect a small salad, a yogurt/tsatziki sauce, choice between a chicken dish and a beef dish, with the lighter meal consisting of a pasta dish. There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back. For longer flights, they provide a little pouch of amenities like an eye mask, ear plugs, slippers, lip balm, and a toothbrush/toothpaste.

A330,Business Class,5.0,May 2015,5.0,1.0,2.0,no,BKK to JFK via IST,3.0," |  Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated.  As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0
A330-300,Business Class,2.0,April 2016,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,CPT to IST via DUR,1.0," |  Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. ​Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet. ​All-in all a rather disappointing and unrefined experience, relieved not to have paid for this trip myself, and wouldn't recommend Turkish Business Class when other (in particular Gulf) airlines offer a far better long-haul product.

Istanbul domestic is similar to La Guardia. Miles&Smiles I contacted TK more than 10 times and spend USD 60 on phone costs without getting any professional reply - at both Istanbul Miles&Smiles desks the staff was busy doing their personal things and any customer was an unwelcomed intrusion. The girl at the outside Miles&Smiles desk made it clear that she will not answer any questions and is only hired to print cards. The guy at the int'l inside Miles&Smiles desk refused to answer my question and I had to pay USD 30 entry fee to a nearby lounge to get my answer. Don't call them. Just write a message and maybe you will receive a reply within 2-8 biz days. If you have anything urgent, too bad. If you have a question at check-in, go directly to the supervisor. There, you might have a chance to get an answer - I asked the supervisor at the Istanbul lounge about the lousy Miles&Smiles service. She refused to answer, refused to investigate, and refused to forward anything. She told me to write an email to customer care - Turkish Airlines staff guided me to the wrong security check-in, because of that, I was stuck with customs / police for over an hour. There is no Turkish Airlines customer care service at Istanbul domestic airport or outside of security at the international terminal.  I contacted customer care and didn't receive any answer to any of above raised points.

A321 and Boeing 777-300 aircraft, flights on time. First flight full, the following only 50% loaded as it is a new route to TK. Check in smooth, though staff had limited experience and understanding. However, lounge access and seat wishes accommodated. Service onboard was top notch. However, despite being kind and service minded, the FAs had very limited English skills and were all of the same, Turkish nationality. Even on the Europe leg, two hot meals of decent quality was offered in economy. Plus free drinks - 3 drink rounds were accomplished. STPC stopover provided in IST, despite the ticket was extremely cheap and said the opposite. IST airport is a hassle with long queues and repetitive security checks. IFE works fine, even on the smaller A321 aircraft. The longhaul leg on Boeing 777-300 was my longest flight ever. Newer aircraft, equipment, and excellent staff. Hot meals served three times. Plenty of drink rounds. Good beers, particularly I liked Tuborg Gold beer on cans. Wines mediocre, both were Turkish. Staff language skills extremely limited, apart from Turkish and Spanish - on the last leg from Sao Paulo to BUE. Amenity kit set with 6 items given. Poor headsets, good IFE. I had no inscribed luggage nor no change/delays issues which make me score TK high, as everybody knows that the problems always come with any irregularity or luggage.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Apparently there are no supervisors or managers who can answer phone calls in customer relations. The managers supposedly solving cases without the need of talking to customer.

Out flights home were a nightmare. Outbound flight left slightly late and when close to Istanbul airport, plane circle the airport 3 times over a 45 minute period which made us nearly miss our connecting flight. We are beyond middle aged and had to run to catch our flight. Economy class was packed with a lot of crying children so I asked if we could be upgraded to business class but they refused. I was sitting in the middle seat in the middle column of seats and the staff ignored me and did not make eye contact. Our luggage did not make it on the plane. Our plane arrived shortly after 7pm and after customs and trying to find a Turkish Airlines rep to fill out the missing luggage form, we didn't leave the airport until 3.5 hours later, We had a 3.5 hour drive home from Houston so we were completely exhausted when we got home. They said we can expect to receive our luggage within 3-4 business days because they will need to put it on a United Airlines flight to San Antonio to get it us. While they are not confrontational, they just pretend that you do not exist after you make a request to be upgraded. Yes, things to wrong sometimes but when they do, I expect the airline to step up and correct the situation. The Turkish Airlines baggage CS rep was very kind and did what she could but all she could do was help us make out the report.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,May 2016,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,TXL to SIN via IST,3.0,"Singapore to Brussels via Istanbul, returning from Berlin.  To Brussels, everything ran like clockwork and a satisfactory experience. Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours  late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldn’t the ground staff in TXL tell me this? We were also told there were food vouchers at the ironically labeled “care point”, staffed by rude employees who spoke poor English. There were no food vouchers; just a free Burger King meal consisting of cheeseburgers and fries if we presented our boarding passes. The Burger King was about to close but our requests were still entertained – initially. However, other passengers cut the queue, finishing the food. The employees refused to cook more because they had to close. IST, while filled with shops and restaurants, is overcrowded and has some of the filthiest washrooms I've seen at any major airport. At the gate, no reasons were provided for delay, and agents only appeared just before boarding. Turkish Airlines gives you the veneer of a professionally-run airline, but disinterested staff refuse to take responsibility for mishaps. Onboard, cabin crew disappeared after the meal service, and spoke poor English. Toilets were not regularly cleaned. Will not fly Turkish Airlines again. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 737-900ER,Business Class,4.0,April 2016,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes,LGW to MBA via IST,3.0," | London Gatwick to Mombasa with Turkish Airlines. TK currently have rock-bottom fares (around £1300 return to MBA from LGW). Arrival / departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor. TK use the new Number 1 lounge at LGW. The ‘onboard chef’ on TK flights is a lot of fuss about nothing. The ‘chef’ on the first short sector to IST is simply a flight attendant in a chef’s hat who serves the drinks and most of the food. There was no chef on the long-haul sector. The food offering was excellent on both flights. There is a Turkish flair to the menu (Mezze, Turkish coffee, Turkish wines), however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate. The seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route. The seats are not flatbed. They are similar to most airline’s Premium Economy seat offer. Good leg-room, a foot rest and good recline. Other than that a normal medium haul business class seat. If I was paying the fare BA or KQ charge on the route I would have something to grumble about, but I am not – so did not. Everyone talks about the lounge at IST. It certainly is large, and impressive with self-service bars throughout, deli-style counters with sweets, cakes and savoury options. The pizza chefs, BBQ chefs, pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them. There is a virtual golf range, scalextric track to ‘play’ with in addition to cinemas, pool tables and a huge library. There are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long. The thing is, the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat (there are no ‘quiet areas’, just lots of seats and tables dotted around). It’s big and brash (like the network and advertising for it), and I will go back – but it’s not ‘special’. The staff were also not especially welcoming. Questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested, “I don’t know – look over there”. There was no feeling of being a special guest. It felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge – now we must fend for ourselves. Even if you are not travelling in business class, IST is a fab transit point. Excellent shops, restaurants and bars. Both my wife and I said it will be our preferred transit stop, whichever class we travel in future. Signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of ‘customer service’. The one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired ‘nod’ in the direction we should go. I would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport (elderly parent etc.), simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty. The service of the flight to Kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu. The presentation could do with some work – meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil (from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef?) which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you. Turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served (nicely) with Turkish delight. This was a little disappointing. Overall, a good product at an excellent price. The food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers. We will definitely book this airline again on this route.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Onboard the service was pretty good with decent food especially since the flights were relatively short. Business class with the A320 is your luck of the draw, on one of the 3 flights in this aircraft type business class was simply an economy seat with the middle seat left empty as is the case with European airlines. This is unfair to passengers who are paying a lot of money only to end up in an economy seat, on the A330 it is a completely different experience with a massive seat, tons of privacy and space an altogether different experience.

We ordered kosher food and it was delicious, well flavored and varied combinations. The best I have tasted in a long time and we are frequent travelers. The planes were all very full. This can be a problem on the long haul flights as the seats are not very widely positioned so when the front one tries to incline you are left with very little feet room.

The food was very good for economy class - I ordered vegetarian meals, which are almost always bland and generally awful, but I had no complaints. They seemed rather sophisticated and quite tasty for airline food, and you actually eat with real, metal utensils. The seats were comfortable enough (probably the most average portion of the flight), and my transatlantic flight had TVs (as expected for a 10-11 hr flight) with good selection, and my shorter flight (4 hrs) had overhead TVs that were available for everyone to watch. Best part of Turkish, though, is that they really do take care of you. On my transatlantic voyage, they provided a package with slippers/blanket/sleep mask/headphones/toothbrush and more. The bathrooms had real flowers in them, and they came around many times with food and drink - first with Turkish Delight, then with a different cake, then with dinner, then coffee/tea, then breakfast, then coffee/tea a second time).

A330-300,Economy Class,4.0,July 2016,5.0,2.0,5.0,yes,LHR to ICN via IST,4.0," |  I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.

The flight was TK0177 on July 19, 2016. This group of attendants were the best I have encountered in a long time, on all the flights I took in the last few years. They were eager to make our experience a pleasant one and they succeeded. Their service was efficient with a smile, and with great attention to detail. I am happy with Turkish Airlines in general but what makes it exceptional is the existence of such employees that elevate boring and long flights to outright enjoyable.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

After another 1h I was informed there was a flight to Dakar the day after, but the boarding flights were printed with mistakes. On 17 July, Turkish Airlines put me on a flight back to Brussels. Therefore, I have never used my partial tickets Istanbul-Dakar and Dakar-Istanbul and they have committed on their website to refund these tickets. However, they are now making it a nightmare to claim back. Throughout the situation, no communication was provided to travellers, staff assistance was poor (the first food provided arrived after more than 10h), and even now the support provided is just not acceptable.

An hour later, the pilot announced that we would not be landing in Istanbul due to ""operational reasons"". This was the one and only announcement given until 12 hours later. We landed in Antalya and were brought into a working terminal.  We sat and waited patiently. At 6am, we were bussed to another terminal - an unused, abandoned terminal with no facilities or options to get food and very little air con on what was an extremely warm morning.  There were no reps from Turkish Airlines, there was no WIFI, there was no communication of any sort.  At midday, a cafe was opened and food served at high prices. The free food of water and bread became tiresome as that was our only option since landing at 4am. At 8pm we were informed our flight would be returning to Istanbul and there we would be met by reps who would transfer our boarding passes. We were assured all would run smoothly and we would have the option of getting a hotel for the night. Upon arrival at Istanbul, we joined the queue for the transfer desk. It took 6.5 hours to reach the top of the queue - no reps, nobody to answer questions, no customer service whatsoever. When we finally got to the desk, we were met by staff members who were more interested in updating their Facebook Status' rather than helping the customers standing in front of them.

Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the  Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out. Once we finally boarded the aircraft most of us passed out with exhaustion for the rest of our journey. Needless to say this is a journey we will not forget in a hurry.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

At the check-in counter I'm told they can't check us in for both flights, ""Because we are two different companies"". They say we have to get the luggage back in Frankfurt and check-in again with Lufthansa. Luggage is not in Frankfurt, I ask for information at the baggage claim and they explain to me when luggage is in transit it's kept in transit 'til the final destination. We move to the departures terminal and check-in again, but there's no seat number on the boarding pass. As we arrive at the gate we find out that the Turkish Airlines employee had jut put us on a waiting list. Boarding refused. We go back to the TK ticket sales and after two hours they manage to find us a new flight for the day after. We ask for our luggage, as we have been wearing the same clothes for 3 days and we find out the luggage is not in Frankfurt at all, as it's been never loaded on our flight from Ataturk. We make a claim (fortunately the German personnel is far more professional than the personnel in Ataturk). They say the luggage will be sent to LAX with the next flight from Ataturk. The day after we finally fly to LAX with a LH flight. Luggage is not there. Another claim, they say to come back the day after because TK made another mistake and sent the luggage to Frankfurt.

Flight from LAX to IST was full and while the catering, inflight entertainment and cabin staff service were good, the impression that remained from this flight was the lack of leg room for such a long haul flight. I'm 1m 80 and my wife 1m 76, which has nothing exceptional in the European population and despite having removed all brochures from the seat pockets in front of us, our knees in a normal seating position were touching the seats in front of us (that were not even inclined). We battled during this 12h30 flight to find the most confortable position without success. A real pity that TK accomodate maximum seats in Economy despite very good 9 seats abreast configuration on this 777-300 (vs 10 for many other airlines). Like many European travelers, we have been attracted to Turkish Airlines by their competitive prices (around 50% cheaper than AF, BA, LH, LX when we booked to the ticket early April), their enviable reputation of Best European Airline by Skytrax for several years in a row and their staff reliability (no strikes recorded during the last few years compare to AF/LH for instance). Transit via IST was OK while extremely crowded highlighting again the dramatic need for TK to operate from the new airport under construction. Flight from IST to GVA was fine (A320) without leg room issues).

Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos. I ended up having to go online and buy a new one-way ticket out of Istanbul. Travel Tip: Find another airline. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

On both ways, there was IFE with a large choice of different international movies and documentaries. Never seen this before on an A321 or/and on short-haul. The flight time was enough to watch one movie. However, When you watched a movie and had your earphones on, the cabin announcements were so loud. Food was delicious. At first you get a turkish delight. For the meal, you could choose between Turkish meat-balls and something with chicken. I had the meat-balls which was great. Alcoholic drinks were free. I took a beer and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were nice. Seat comfort is ok. I'm 5ft. 10in. I had enough space to the front and for my legs. The space to my neighbour was fine.

Moreover, Turkish Airlines lounge is free of charge for business class passengers. The seats in the business class are wide and comfortable with ability to transform a seat to bed-like resting position. The in-flight entertainment is wonderful - from many new movies, channels, series, etc. Inflight service is excellent with very attentive flight attendants. The meal service was simply fantastic - bext to appetizers, there is a selection of 3 possible main course choices (but I did not like any of them (veal, shrimp, vegetarian), so I was offered extra choice of chicken - to my own surprise).

We got to Kilimanjaro airport early and then when it came to check in three people from my group including myself weren't on the list to fly! We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later). We asked 5 people at the airport for help and the staff were all rude saying 'I'm busy' and walking off. Eventually we found someone who told her where to go but it was too late she had missed her flight. I then got on my next plane to Heathrow, once landed at 4.30 I went to collect my luggage, I waited an hour and a half for them to then say 'That's all the bags.' Which meant 6 out of 7 people I was with didn't have their rucksacks. We all went over to lost luggage and there we got told all our bags weren't on the flight and that they were on the next flight coming from Istanbul. If we had been told this earlier it wouldn't have been as big an issue yet we waited an hour and half and parking at an airport isn't cheap! There was no communication at all. We got told we could wait till the next flight came in which was gone 9 in the evening or get our bags delivered to us in a few days.

Onboard the aircraft looked newish. The FA's were courteous and spoke decent English. The lie-flat seat was comfortable but narrow and the crew turned into a bed by using a mattress and duvet.

So I got the flight to Istanbul but the situation I found at the airport was terrible. A lot of flights were cancelled. I found out that my flight to SFO was delayed by 5 hours, so I went to the gate and waited there. Then, after 5 hours waiting, they announced that all flights on that day were cancelled and asked passengers to go out of the terminal and ask for a hotel in the Turkish Airlines desk. I went out of the airport but my luggage was not in the baggage carrousel. I went to the hotel desk and they asked everybody there to enter in a bus and we were taken to a hotel. There a Turkish Airlines staff told me that my luggage will be delivered to the hotel and that my flight to SFO was confirmed to the next day. At the next day, we discovered that all flights from Turkey to USA were cancelled and we should wait another day.

I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me £20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further £1050 for a business class ticket or £435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on.

BHX to IST a comfortable B737-800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew weren't very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasn't very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330-300, much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT, including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities (toothbrush, socks.etc) given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPT-IST via Durban on an A330-300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737-800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall, not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end. Turkish offers a very good business class product on long-haul routes and I would not hesitate to use them again. They must however improve boarding and gate arrangements in IST which are deplorable.",Business,4.0,1.0

Once you book your tickets, you need to fill a form called APIS, to be able to check in and print the boarding pass. We tried this online many times, it got to a point that I wanted to cancel the flights. I had to contact their customer services but again, no luck to talk to anyone who can speak English clearly. We travelled to the airport to sort the problem and book our seats. Our flight was delayed 2 hours, found out at the airport. This caused further problem as we had a transfer flight from Istanbul to Antalya. We were dumped at the Istanbul Ataturk airport, no one there to tell us where to go or what to do. I speak Turkish so we could find our way and helped others. We needed to pass security points, walked almost 1 hour to get to the international to domestic side. But the domestic flight delayed too and we arrived there at 12:35 midnight to find that one of the luggage was left in Istanbul. We waited until 1:45 at their customer services to be told that it was not their problem, it was Istanbul. After long discussion we were told that they would send our luggage the next day.

Both ways we were refused hotel or a 2 hour room. We were not alone - the same was happening to people flying to and from Johannesburg. It seems Turkish Airlines are offering flights with long stop overs and not giving the consumers the option of shorter stop overs then trapping them at Istanbul airport. This airport has some of the most over inflated duty free shops I've ever seen. Research the flights carefully even though Turkish Airlines are not offering shorter stop overs when puting your from and to destinations, there are and people are being forced to spend more than half a day in Istanbul airport.

Turkish Airlines might be the best in Europe due to their good product between Istanbul and European cities but their hard product on long haul routes is very outdated and horrendous. Especially on the A330-200. The planes are old, dirty and the seats often broken. To top it off, the inflight enterntainment did not work on a 13 hour flight. An airline should be consistent and offer the same hard product in C-class across their entire fleet. Their flight attendants are brash and lack the professionalism of other airlines in Star Alliance. I find the food very over-rated, in fact almost everything is almost tacky, starting from the presentation of the menu to the dinner service with the fake candle. This airline lacks the ""finesse"" of its biggest European competitors. When I asked my seat neighbour, who hails from Eastern Europe and now lives in Panama, why he doesn't fly with other airlines, his answer was simply ""I like the price"".

However, the customer service is terrible, I can remember 4-5 terrible interactions with airline staff in various occasions (flight attendants, airport staff, ticketing). Ataturk Airport, is not well-equipped. You won't have access to even wifi. I do not recommend this airline if you're going to have a long connection time at that airport.

On the positive side, food is excellent, service is attentive and overnight on long distance is a good as it can get on a plane. Transit in Istanbul has been reported as problem by numerous passengers. This is due to outsourcing to TAS Turkish Airport Services which is not part of TK. TK has made efforts to make transit as pleasant as possible in IST, such as allowing transit passengers to access the departure level without going through security control again and providing the most fabluous lounge in the world. If you have a jetty for departure, boarding is a very orderly process. Problems arise when there is no jetty and passengers just scramble into a shuttle.

Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapés served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff. Having travelled to Mauritius many times in British Airways business class and experienced the scruffy aircraft and the lack of service, travelling with Turkish Airlines was a breath of fresh air much more @like being-in first class.

The check in experience was relatively easy at Casablanca airport, with no option to fast track at passport control despite the level of Star Alliance membership.

It is almost a 5 hour flight and the inflight entertainment did not work. The cabin crew were very indifferent and told me there was nothing they could do about it.

Outbound flight is an overnight flight and the meal is served early in the flight allowing passengers to sleep for the rest of the journey. Experience was OK apart from the comfort of the seat. Legroom was great as I was in an exit seat, but the seat is very hard which is very uncomfortable for a 5 hour journey. The return flight some days later was on an identical (maybe the same) aircraft. A hot breakfast (that was actually very cold) was served at the beginning of the 6 hour return flight followed by some drinks a few hours later. For such a long journey I would expect a light refreshment to be served towards the latter part of the flight and a hotter meal. On both flights most of the crew were very indifferent and non-caring towards passengers with the exception of some who appeared to be from Kazakhstan who seemed to be smiling and helpful. On descent into Ataturk Airport water started to stream out of the ceiling (perhaps from melting ice) of the plane onto me and the passenger in front of me. We were both seated in exit row seats by the window. It was not possible to get out of my seat at this time as we were so close to landing so I had to use pillows and blankets to cover myself from the water. Due to a bird strike incident with the plane in front of us we had to ascend sharply to make another landing approach. We flew for a further ten minutes before landing safely. Pilot communication during this incident was very acceptable which was pleasing. I advised the flight attendant on exiting about the water leak and my clothing she told me that this sometimes happens - very poor attitude towards customer.

Got a complimentary 5* hotel for my layover, yet had to wait for almost an hour before it was arranged (without any crowd at the desk). Another negative point for ground service - staff at Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul was unable to handle any reservation change, been told to go to transfer desk (which is in the arrivals area and would thus need to re-clear security to get back to departures). Istanbul to Buenos Aires a slightly worn Boeing 777, yet full recline seat.

I travel a lot of airlines between Boston and Bombay, and the tickets with Turkish Airlines were significantly cheaper. For the most part Turkish Airlines is average. The Istanbul airport layout leaves a lot to be desired but is made up by the food (Pistachio Icecream and Lamb). My complaint is with their Customer service which is abysmal. I needed to delay my departure because my Father-in-law was very ill. They had no Customer Service in India. I called their HQ and even though I selected the English option, they continued to talk in Turkish. I then called the US office (might as well). They gave a price 3 times my original fare just to change the dates ($2000 per ticket - my original fare was $850). To top it all, they will not accept credit cards. I would have to mail them a ""check"" and when they got it they would change it if there was availability! ",Family Leisure,4.0,2.0
A321,Economy Class,3.0,November 2016,4.0,2.0,3.0,no,IST to MUC,2.0," | Istanbul to Munich return journey with Turkish Airlines. We had previously tried to rebook our flights via the TK homepage as we had originally planned to fly back to MUC on Friday 11th. Unfortunately, TK´s homepage in Turkey is different (""old version"") from the one available in Germany (""new version""). If you try to rebook a flight or do your online check-in on the old version the programme will send you into nirvana. Thus we wasted half a day going to their city office at Taksim Square to rebook the flight with the help of an unfriendly and unpologetic office clerk who charged a hefty rebooking fee. For the online check-in we tried the Taksim Square office again which turned out to be closed but we were fortunate enough to find out there is another office nearby at Harbiye where the nice and helpful TK staff was able to assign our seats but not to print out our boarding passes - TK, an airline full of mystery. On Sunday, security/passport checks at Ataturk airport surprisingly efficient despite general overcrowding and TK ground staff in the check-in area friendly and helpful. We went to gate 206 and found there are no info screens stating destination or scheduled boarding time. Boarding started 30 minutes after scheduled time; no explanation, no apology. Previously, TK staff came around checking some passports and boarding passes for no apparent reason as they had been checked before, then he got distracted by something and never returned. As boarding got underway, TK did something that sums up the whole way that they do things: there were 3 boarding channels for economy class passengers appropriately named A, B and C, plus a separate channel for business class passengers. TK staff opens business class channel first and then minds her own business, with the effect that all passengers, business class or not, stampede through the business class channel until they realise the plane is half full and blocks off business class channel, arguing with passengers who don´t understand what is going on while the rest of us are waiting patiently at A, B or C. Ambience on the plane just as bad as on our inbound flight to Istanbul, except the staff were friendlier and more efficient, and the food was better. Cabin announcements just as erratic, English version totally unintelligible. We took off almost an hour late because of rush hour at Ataturk and were merely informed by the captain that we would land 30 minutes late in Munich, no apology. Back in Munich, the usual sluggish MUC immigration and customs, 2 officers for a planeload of 200 people (not TK´s fault for a change). TK´s performance on this flight was better than on the inbound flight, but I would still recommend using another airline if you can.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

The cabin was clean and modern, legroom bearable, seat pitch uncomfortable, plane fully booked, cabin overheated. We had tried to stay within limitations for hand luggage but found out that nobody else bothered. Cabin staff stressed and unsmiling, delivering uncoordinated service, running back and forth with the trolleys, standing in each other´s way,  and forgetful if you ordered anything extra. Cabin announcements erratic language-wise, sometimes in Turkish, English, German, sometimes in Turkish, English; English announcements hard to understand. Personal IFE didn't provide 3D-maps. Food quite eatable but served lukewarm. After landing at Ataturk airport (breathtaking views of the city during approach!), erratic announcements that didn´t bother to mention the local time. Ataturk airport is a surprise in that it is overcrowded but still manages to operate immigration and customs quite swiftly (Munich take note!).

While the Amman to Istanbul trip was short and uneventful trouble started once you reach Ataturk airport. This is probably not the fault of the airline but the airport is in no way capable of handling so much traffic. The TK lounge is big and offers a lot, it is so crowded now that it has no premium feel about it - you feel stuck in a crowded noisy bus station. The wifi service is a joke and keeps disconnecting probably from the too large number of people trying to use the service. The planes used to Bogota were old A330s with the old style business class seats which meant no lie flat beds on a 15 hour flight. The crew (it happened to be the same crew on the flight out and back) spoke very little English and semed almost robotic in their behaviour. The food was acceptable and not as fantastic as some reviews suggest. The so called ""flying chef"" gave me a surprised look when I inquired if I could have my breakfast two hours before landing in Bogota! ",Business,1.0,nan

For dinner I had chicken with an aubergine and avocado salad, wild mushroom soup and roast beef filet. Desert was a mango panacotta with mango ice cream. Fully flat reclining seat meant that I got some sleep though a bigger pillow would have helped. Had to refuse breakfast as I was too full from the night before. Upon landing a separate bus whisked all the Business class passengers to the terminal and we grabbed a shower in the arrivals lounge and had my shirt ironed. While the British Airways experience declines, the Turkish gets better. They get all my East European and Far East travel now.

After dinner you get a bottle of water - if you need more until breakfast you pick it up yourself. Food was good, dessert excellent. Drink selection OK, but I had to beg for alcoholic drinks.

When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess.

A321,Economy Class,2.0,September 2016,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,SVX to BCN via IST,2.0," |  In September 2016 I had a horrible experience with Turkish Airlines. My flight (TK-476) was on 17/09 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Barcelona via Istanbul. The time of departure was supposed to be at 7.30 - arriving time to Istanbul at 10.15 and the departure to BCN at 14.40 - so having 4.25 hours would be more than enough to change the plane in Istanbul. Unfortunately the Turkish Airlines delayed the flight in Russia for more than 3 hours. I can understand that there might be some technical problems or something but in that case the company is supposed to ""think"" of its passengers and be more client-oriented which I haven't noticed. The representatives didn't give any explanations regarding the reasons of delay, time of the flight, food, etc. When we finally arrived to Istanbul we still had enough time to catch the plane to BCN (we had 1 hour before the flight) and  they could delay the plane for 15-20 min to let us in (I was not the only passenger - we were like 20 people who found themselves in this situation).  The only thing they said was ""sorry, you have to wait for the next plane"" (additional 5 hours of waiting). They ignored us and our questions. After that I asked for food and I was given some sort of a coupon which was possible to use only in some places in food court. The cheapest ones, as I realized later. So the only thing I managed to have using this coupon was a bottle of water. Therefore sitting in Istanbul airport waiting for the plane for 5 hours I had to spend my money on normal food in a normal place. For the information: before that in Russia I was waiting for 3 hours and nobody informed me about breakfast so again I had to spend my money on food there. My advice to Turkish Airlines:  teach your employees how to communicate with clients and to be more client-oriented. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

However, had a truly awful experience with their customer service during the return flight, Istanbul was hit by blizzards the afternoon of the evening return flight which caused chaos with cancellations of all flights from all Istanbul airports, unfortunate, not much one can do about the weather. What is deplorable is the experience I have had with their customer service. Given the situation as one can imagine the ticket sales/changes queue at the airport was astronomical with everyone trying to rearrange travel arrangements. Spoke with a THY staff member who said I could rearrange over the phone. Waiting for half an over on the phone reached a customer service representative who informed me that as the KL to Perth flight was with a partner airline and THY they could not complete the booking and I had to go in person to the THY ticket office. So I went to the other airport in Istanbul at 3am in a taxi in a blizzard. Upon arriving at the ticket sales office they said they emailed the partner airline but that we would have to wait for a confirmation response. No indication of time frames. We waited for an hour then a different staff member told us that there was no need for us to wait at the airport and that in fact there was no need for us to have come in person to the airport to do this and the call staff had misinformed us. After getting a few hours sleep I then spent half the day repeatedly calling Turkish Airlines chasing any updates. Eventually I was told that in fact we were on standby with the other airline which was strange as the other airlines website was showing tickets for sale. After tearing my hair out eventually I spoke directly with the original booking travel agent who changed the booking no problem wish I had done that sooner rather than wasting my time with THY. Unfortunately the same issue has happened again with the rebooked flight tonight being cancelled due to weather and I am now going through the entire process again. No one can or will give me a telephone number for the ticket sales office instead I am told that I have to get a taxi, drive an hour each way if I'm lucky in the snow and repeat the crazy process of telling the ticket sales office in person exactly what I've told the call centre for them to lodge the booking request with the other airline and then wait until who knows when for them to get back. I have repeatedly asked to speak to a more senior management staff at the call centre to resolve the issue to be told there is no one more senior. Considering the trip was bought as one continuous flight how on earth THY cannot resolve this from their end with the partner airline beggars belief and why on earth one has to physically go to the ticket office to do this seems illogical and hugely inconvenient.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan

Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago.

However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.

I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do. All we got was wrong information and their ground staff kept sending us from one desk to another. That first night, after 4 hrs spent in the airport to get some information, I decided to go to an hotel paid by myself. The following morning (07 January) we were informed that all flights were cancelled again due to snow and I had to queue almost 7 hrs at the ticketing office to rebook my flight for the next day. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself again, as there was another extremely long queue at their hotel information desk. On 08 January, my flight to KRT cancelled again and again 7 hours of queue to rebook the flight. The third day I went to the airport in the morning, this time the flight was confirmed so I checked in and entered the departure area after passport control but the flight to KRT was cancelled once again at about 04.00 PM and again a chaotic queue at the immigration and after another queue at the ticket office to re-change my flight, with no help or guidance from TK staff. After that and after 3 more hours of queue to get an hotel, I managed to have a room only at 04 AM, since we spent time driving around Istanbul looking for a free hotel, since they were all full booked with TK passengers stranded in the city. On 10 January I managed to depart with a delay of two hours. This was my last time flying with Turkish Airlines.",Business,2.0,nan

Flew Turkish Airlines from Singapore to Istanbul. Booked this as the price dropped, presumably as a result of terrorist activity in Turkey and the region. Check-in at Singapore very efficient. Boarding very quick. ""Comfortable"" seats for the twelve hour flight, great hi-def seat back tv with good movie selection (but not as good a selection as Emirates). Great crew - all Turkish, polyglot crew, unlike other airlines whose crew are like the United Nations. They were so generous with the free alcohol that I slept most of the way - the flight was at 23.30 - so cannot comment on the food. Will fly Turkish again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0

There was no food or water provided from Turkish Airlines. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself as there was another 4 hrs queue at their hotel information desk.

The time spent in flight was alright, food is ok, flight attendants are competent and nice enough and the entertainment is ok. The legroom is a bit tight though. But the transfer at Ataturk airport was an absolute disaster. They had snow 4 days before and still had not recover from it. All flights were delayed, the airport was packed, people were sleeping on the floor - complete chaos. Our flight was delayed every hour without any reason, and nobody at the airport could help us, they were rude and useless, couldn't give a damn about any passengers. After 5 long hours of waiting without any help, finally a boarding gate appeared. We rushed there and suddenly this mass of people rushed to the check in counter and the boarding was delayed. Nobody told us what was happening, we couldn't understand because they were speaking in Turkish, but we finally understood that they were trying to get on board because they had been stuck in Istanbul for four days.  I thought we would stay stuck as well for days. We boarded the flight in complete chaos, they tried to change our seats that we booked months ago, the entertainment system crashed, and when we arrived the luggage took forever and was wet.

If that were not bad enough the next time they said they would be flying was 2 days later on Monday.  But it is now Monday and they have had the better part of two days to deal with the snow and the weather is crystal clear in Dushanbe. But is the flight coming on time? No. It is delayed 5.5 hours, assuming it arrives at all. That has destroyed the rest of my itinerary. I am going to have to spend the night in Istanbul as a result in the best case scenario. This is not the first time Turkish has screwed up my travel.

We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places.  Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at Atatürk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at Atatürk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier. Overall we recommend Turkish Airlines.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route.  Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish.  They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin. The final part is that 2 of my luggage get lost on this flight, Turkish Airlines cannot locate my luggage, and each representative over the phone tells different location.

I got the information that I could be booked on the next available flight (24 hours later) and that I could get a free night in hotel (I am paying for my hotel in Addis). Past the passport control we had to queue for more than one hour to get to the ""hotel desk"" by Turkish Airlines where staff took our boarding passes and 40 minutes later appeared calling our names and then bringing to get a shuttle to a 5 stars hotel in the middle of nowhere.

The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight.

The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies.

Return sector was even better - the flight left the gate at Lisbon Airport on time. Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board. A slightly different brand of amenities kit was given out on this flight, but the contents were the same. On-time arrival in Singapore. The only thing that I didn't like was the seat and legroom on the Singapore-Istanbul sector, but overall Turkish Airlines put a smile on my face. I look forward to flying with them again.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0
A330,Business Class,3.0,March 2017,2.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Istanbul to Montreal,4.0, |  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Used the business class check in which was hassle free. The lounge in Istanbul offered a great array of drink and meal options but the shower facilities were falling apart and appeared in need of an upgrade. Boarding was on time and orderly and we left on time. On board the seating was comfortable and FA's were attentive. Turkish Airlines catering is on a serious decline with portions smaller and quality not what it used to be. My main course was two pieces of overcooked thin slices of beef. The meal before landing was also disappointing. The wine selection was OK and Tattinger was appreciated. Toilets were not kept clean and I had to point out to FA's on two occoasions the need for a touch up. The wifi was reliable. Thee IFE was decent but could have used more recent movie releases. Announcements from the cockpit were scarce with flight details provided only in the beginning. Flight arrived ahead of schedule.,Business,3.0,4.0

The price was very good for this route. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and it was just fairly good. IFE had a good selection of movies also to keep me entertained, and they give you amenity kit which is nice. The planes were fairly nice too, minus on the way back home, Istanbul to Amsterdam, the aircraft was old and had no IFE, was a bit disappointing. The meals are very good overall, I loved the Cafe De Paris Chicken. Staff were so so, when I stepped in the plane, the two male FA's who are supposed to welcome people suddenly started chatting, and not welcoming me, not sure what this was about. On another flight they forgot to give me bread with my meal, they serve the bread after the meal I saw them giving other people but they never gave me.

A320,Economy Class,2.0,January 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,Amsterdam to Antalya via SAW,4.0," |  I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich; all that looked a bit unnecessary on this 50 min flight. On my way backed I changed in IST, the main airport in Istanbul. Both flights were quite the same as on my way from AMS, except that the aircraft of the IST-AMS was a B737-800 with a good entertainment system, in contrast to the entertainment system, the cabin looked quite worn, with the cracks on plastic details. The food offer is the same “a bit below average” menu as on the AMS-SAW flight. Summing up, the Turkish can be OK for point-to-point connections, but I would avoid transfer flights with them. SAW cannot handle transfers in a decent manner, due to apparent infrastructural, organisational and human capacity constraints. IST is slightly better, but it is very crowded, not very clean, poorly organised and has very confusing navigation, I had no contacts with transfer staff there, but got a few hints that the expectation should be high. There is no free internet in both airports, and the paid access is quite challenging to configure and get through. The voucher for the cheapest McDonalds meal in SAW was the final touch in the ungraceful picture of transfers in IST and SAW. ",Business,3.0,nan

It was my first time flying with Turkish on long haul flight and I was expecting a good experience. The food was bad on all the flights we had. The A330-300 from Istanbul to Singapore seemed old. The touch screens were not working normally, only with the remote that made navigation uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment was really good though. It would have been nice if cabin crew would have offered drinks and snacks during the flight in addition to the dinner and breakfast served. On the way back from Singapore to Istanbul we were seated in the isle and it was just so cold, I was sitting with a hat, scarf, sweater, cardigan, blanket on me and my wool coat way over my head and I still got sore throat.

Flew TK for the first time (return flight) and I found it a bit overrated. Service and reliability is no better than most EU majors, and overall the comfort and service looks from another time. The seats and interiors are really old, and very narrow on the A320 models (a kid won't even fit). Service is not really outstanding like you read in reviews, just basic and a bit cheap. Cabin staff can be quite stiff and really not friendly, which does not give the best sense of welcome claimed in their marketing. However the ground staff in Istanbul is quite outstanding and efficient! Our flight was 40min late with only 1 hour connection, but someone waits at the exit gate and takes groups of pax with short connections directly to the next gate; within 5min you are in the next flight which is unusual for connecting trips. My travel partner had also forget his tablet in the first leg aircraft from TBS, and immediately the gate staff had it collected and brought directly to the boarding of the next leg while we were boarding. Very smooth and ultra efficient! Even Lufthansa is not that efficient from my experience.  At least they make it up in the aggressive pricing",Business,3.0,nan

On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

A330-200 / Boeing 737,Business Class,5.0,April 2017,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul,4.0," |  Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

Toilets were kept clean and are now getting stocked with new nice amenities (flowers, high-quality hand lotions and hand cream) which on other airlines you would find on business class only.

Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself.

No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice;  ignoring the claim made and it would appear all text entered on their system; saying a bag whose main zip was broken to the point of not being able to shut anymore 'does not constitute any impediment for use of the baggage'; and not seeming to have a central complaint team.

TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew.

In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows.

Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep.

Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.",Business,1.0,nan

The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. IST-KUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present, is TK a hit or miss?

Fortunately, some of the medications, which my husband had in his possession, were couriered to me from New York. To cut a long story short, finally after my bag reached its destination, instead of the airline delivering the bag, I had to collect it from La Guardia airport.

I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight.

I had an early breakfast (this was quite adequate, although I would have liked a little more given no dinner the previous night). No further food was offered.

My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston.  Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable.

As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx £120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx £230 for my extra bag. £110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.,Business,1.0,nan

One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them.

I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with.  The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing.

I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling.  They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer. ",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Very comfortable seats which can be changed to a bed with one button or to different positions and I slept well on the long flights. The lounge in Istanbul is amazing and also The Eva Air lounge in Bangkok that Turkish Airlines passengers can use was very classy. I enjoyed eating in both of them. Overall I can recommend Turkish Airlines Business class. It was a pleasure. The only small minus was on the Turkey legs I didn't feel acknowledged during boarding being a business class passenger.",Business,5.0,5.0

Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, “there is a phone and computer, google your help.” I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person. I am sorry Turkish Airlines, even though the flight experience was decent, with edible food, drink and entertainment, the manner in which you treated me is beyond appalling.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

It took us 20 minutes to make us inside the terminal. Next the international transfer security check was overwhelmed with passengers. I tried talking to the staff to let me go first but they said stay where you are in the lane - all passengers say that same things to go first. As a result I missed my connection. I went to the transfer desk for Turkish Airline. The lady said he will get me fixed on the next flight that leaves in three hours. She said I should wait while she gets a new boarding pass. I waited and waited. Followed up 5 times. Each time I was told not to worry and its being done. After 3 hours - a gentleman from Turkish Airways told me that it was my fault that I missed the connection. 1 hour was more than enough to get the connection. I explained to him the reasons but he said still fault is mine! I asked him if this is what the case is than why I was made to wait for 3 hours? He had no answer to that and stopped talking to me. he said he can give me next day flight and refused to answer me further. He refused to pay for my visa and hotel as well. ",Business,1.0,nan

Food was fairly good, but no better than QR or a number of other carriers.

It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some don’t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600€ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didn’t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just don’t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight.  These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They don’t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They don’t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, that’s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April.  The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldn’t be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again.

TK uses a third party to handle their ground formalities in Beijing and need to be aware of the terribly rude and substandard service by check-in and gate agents. My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airline’s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading. For instance the captain referred to de-icing being completed in 5 minutes’ time when no de-icing equipment were in sight. Overall it was a mediocre to OK flight.",Business,4.0,4.0

The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card.

When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn’t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

Boeing 777-300ER,Business Class,5.0,May 2018,2.0,3.0,4.0,no,Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul,3.0," |  Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. I’m a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won’t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.",Business,2.0,2.0

As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.",Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0

Older IFE on this flight with less choices of games and movies which unfortunately not translated in exotic languages. During the night flight cabin crew came with drinks or ice cream. 2 Hours before landing we were woken up with tasty breakfast and warm rolls and croissant.

I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn’t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless. If you can opt for another European Airline instead of THY, please do so. ",Business,1.0,nan

However, it was Sunday afternoon, so there was less traffic than during the week. Only two minuses were baggage delivery at IST - the monitors are not updated regularly or are too small for such a big number of arrivals so our baggage was already out and we still did not see information about the belt and the staff at the SAW airport. I had the feeling that there we were punished for flying with Turkish as the airport is hub for the competition airline. Boarding was not even announced properly, just somebody shouted. On the return flight stop over in IST was very pleasant with smooth security control. In flight service great, friendly staff, good food. The only minus is big difference in equipment.

The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations.

The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and  smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well.

Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers.  I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price.

Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect.

If someone from the office tried to find it more aggressively, I could get it back earlier. Lost baggage is irregular thing.

And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport.  On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore.

Some part of the ventilation system, I think, was not working. They kept us on the plane for the first two hours. Since Istanbul is about an hour and a half of flying time away, it is beyond me why they didn't send a replacement plane, instead of having us waiting around until they managed to fix it. Well, money, obviously. But doesn't bad experiences and bad reviews hurt you longer in the long run!?",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0
nan,Economy Class,1.0,April 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,Los Angeles to Tirana via Istanbul,3.0," |  Los Angeles to Tirana via Istanbul. I traveled to Albania on April 28th to visit my sister. Once I got there they did not have my suitcase and when I request information they said “they cannot locate it”. I arrive with no suitcase and no personal stuff.  I went to Airport twice still Turkish had no idea where is my suitcase, so I bought some clothes and hygiene stuff. I kept my receipt. Monday I went back to airport because by phone I could not get respond. Monday by noon we waited there no suitcase. I went back to hotel and at 10pm my hotel customer service called and said my luggage is here. Suitcase was damaged but it was ok with me and I was happy to be able to give all the gift I bought to my sister. After I came back I send a receipt of my purchased items, Turkish send me $41 check as reimbursement. I did file complaint with BBB and they just told me with several request respond from Turkish they never responded to me or BBB. Horrible customer service. If you have connection from Istanbul you are doomed with unorganized service and no one takes responsibility.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

After three attempts to complete the check in with Turkish Airlines customer service agents, the fourth attempt was a complete fiasco. The supervisor  was not able to complete the check in with all the information available. Plus they told me that I have just one luggage (not two as it should be for transatlantic flights), for the second one needing to pay just $165. Disappointment, stress , waste of time and of course money are a soft description of the Turkish Airlines incompetent customer service.",Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0

The ground service is the worst as they barely understand any sort of English. The aircraft was in a poor shape even that it was one of the more recent planes, the service was not just terrible but the food was tasteless. I am much surprised how bad this airline became.",Business,2.0,1.0
Boeing 777-300ER & A321,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,Singapore to Venice via Istanbul,4.0," |  Singapore to Venice via Istanbul. Cabin crew on both legs attentive and friendly. They came to me at the end of both segments to ask whether I liked the service and enjoyed the flight. Old business class seat on the Singapore to Istanbul route: this seat type should be removed by Turkish as it is uncompetitive. Had a good sleep though as the space for legs is excellent. Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine on-demand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their long-haul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual - looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October. Due to very bad weather over India, the first flight landed in Istanbul behind schedule and one of my four luggage did not make it to the final destination. It arrived to Venice with the following flight and was delivered on the same day by the airline directly to my place.",Business,5.0,5.0
Boeing 777,Economy Class,1.0,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,New York to Istanbul,1.0," |  New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was  without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane. I probably will not take this airline again.",Business,1.0,1.0
Boeing 777-300ER,Economy Class,1.0,May 2018,2.0,3.0,5.0,no,Manila to Tel Aviv via Istanbul,4.0," |  Manila to Istanbul via flight TK85 and reached Istanbul at 5:20AM. I changed my flight from Istanbul to Tel Aviv to 11AM from the 6PM flight, paid U$81.00 and was assured that my check-in luggage will be transferred to the same flight. When I reached Tel Aviv, my check-in luggage was not in the same flight, nor in the next flight. I submitted a complaint note and my luggage was delivered to my hotel the next day. It was a big hassle for me because I was to attend a business conference at Tel Aviv Convention centre. Airline does not have the service that they promised passenger despite the fact that I paid for the changed flight. They also have very poor cabin service on TK85 in a sense that while I was still eating, the stewardess took the tray because she said that it was time for them to pull back trays. The service is too mechanical.",Business,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul,1.0," |  Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.",Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0

Make sure to check out their reviews online before you buy a ticket from them.  Dealing with Turkish Airlines is a nightmare. They have very poor customer service, the employees are very rude, ""unfriendly and unprofessional"". They seem to have a “no smile” policy. They will not listen to your needs and ignore your complaints. They will not take responsibility or apologize to make up for your losses when they screw up. I do not recommend using Turkish Airlines.  I flew with them 25 years ago and had a bad experience back then. I had hoped that they had improved their services since then, but instead it went from bad to worse.",Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0

Asian vegetarian catering tasty and divers, good beverage options. Toilets clean through the whole flights, even with fresh roses, toilet water and hand cream. A very nice touch. The staff on all flights friendly and very professional. Amenity kit with slippers, lip balm, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush is available and very much appreciated. All flights on time, arriving even ahead of schedule to final destinations. The only negative side is their hub: Istanbul Ataturk airport is overcrowded and dirty, staff unfriendly, even rude.",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0
nan,Business Class,1.0,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,Calgary to Nairobi via Istanbul,1.0," |  I travelled with Turkish Airlines from Calgary to Nairobi via Istanbul on July 1st (arrived on the 3rd). When I got to Kenya, my bags didn’t make it. There were many other people in the same situation, as there was a big line up at their counter. After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. I’m lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didn’t even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things. Now, I’m stuck in Africa for 20 days with no bags, no clothes, and Turkish has not even offered me any type of compensation. I was travelling on Business Class and that’s how they treat their Business Class flyers.",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0
