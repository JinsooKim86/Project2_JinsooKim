nan,Economy Class,3.0,February 2018,nan,1.0,nan,no,Johannesburg to Durban,1.0, | Flew Kulula from Johannesburg to Durban. Long wait. Under staffed. Rude. Asked for seat with leg room and he put me in back seat with no leg room. Awful. This isnt the first time. Particularly poor is the attitide of the check in staff. Also not well presented or dressed but mainly lack of service.,Business,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,November 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Durban to Lanseria,3.0, |  Durban to Lanseria. My wife was at check-in 40 mins before flight and only found out then that Kulula changed the check-in times from 30 mins to 45 mins before departure. No Kulula employee was willing to help even thought she had a small bag which could be taken in as hand luggage. This happened on the 13th Nov 2017 and I emailed Kulula on that day and to date I have not received any response. Pathetic customer service from Kulula.,Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

Had a very bad experience with Kulula flying from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I had picked exit row seats when purchasing the tickets months in advance. When we go to leave the bags at the counter they said the flight had changed. They reassigned seats and I asked them to make sure to give us exit row seats. They agreed and said we had exit row seats. One of our group had a check in bag 2 kg over the limit. The other check in bags were 6 kg, 2 kg, and 1 kg under the limit. But they said for the 2 kg overage which would cost us R300 or we have to move things around. So after 5 minutes of shuffling things around they say we are good to go. Once we get onboard we realize not only are these not exit row seats but we can not recline the seat back. Customer service is deplorable.

I also checked in online but my seats that I had specifically chosen were disregarded as another aircarft had to be used. The service was in my opinion a little unprofessional and I found it really disappointing as I felt that I did not get my money's worth regarding both flights.

nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,I took 2 Kulula flights on my recent trip to South Africa and must say I had mixed feelings about the airline. Although both flight (JNB-CPT and George-JNB) were dirt cheap you could see that it is a low-cost airline.

On my way from George to JNB 3 of the young girls who were suppose to help passengers with boarding procedures were flirting with one guy! They were standing at his seat one with her foot on the empty seat chatting with him! They were unfriendly to the other passengers or totally ignored us standing in the way so that it was difficult for us to reach our seats. The snacks were also not that cheap as stated below. Then the cockpit door was open during the whole flight from George to JNB!!! What about safety? Talking about safety instructions I know they are trying to make it a bit funny but I just couldn't get myself to laugh. All in all it was OK but next time I will try the other low cost airline 1Time first before flying with Kulula again.,nan,nan,nan

The initial flight I booked was cancelled by cell phone and we were placed on the next flight with no apology and great inconvenience to ourselves. On our return flight we were bumped at the last moment having arrived 2 hours early-then told they could actually fit us in? The flight by then was running at least 3/4 an hour late. The couple ahead of us had been bumped twice that day.,nan,nan,nan

The 6 hour delay at JNB International with 3 children under 4 was an experience I could have done without. The hostesses were I am sure quite funny but at that stage I was in no mood to laugh and found their flippancy annoying and somehow insulting considering the 8 tortuous hours we had just spent because of that airline. Still waiting for their ""feedback department"" to get back to me 2 months later. My advice is to arrive really early because when it goes wrong its not all fun and games.",nan,nan,nan

Lanseria is the best way to fly to Durban the extra cost is well worth not having to go via OR Tambo. We were given vouchers to make up for the inconvenience of the delay - a nice touch. Lanseria ran out of food so Kulula organised sandwiches at the airport. One complaint the snacks are very expensive - R9.00 for a 200ml can of Coke! Surely after a delay that long the drinks should be free on the flight?,nan,nan,nan

As this was going to inconvenience me I tried calling them to see if I could reschedule. This is where I saw how abysmal Kulula after sales service is. After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel (at R2.40 a minute) telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory. I don't like the Kulula 'jokey' approach and the 'funny' announcements - most of the FA's simply can't pull it off and it's just irritating.,nan,nan,nan

This never materialised. I was lied to the following day regarding departure times and the mystery charter plane. Eventually told we were on a 16:20 flight. At 16:00 they told us it was delayed to 18:20! Finally my nightmare ended at 20:00 on 12 June when we finally touched down in Durban.
