Not difficult to tell that Singapore Airlines is involved as a partner in this airline. Check-in, boarding, and in-flight service were all superb. Flight was on-time and bags reached the carousel before we did. vistara doesn't have as extensive a network as the other Indian airlines, but seem to be in expansion model.

The gentleman at check-in was extremely professional, courteous, and helpful, as were the rest of the staff. The aircraft was modern and clean. The only small downside on the whole flight was the fact that they run their own rewards program, rather than being integrated with existing international programs ie Flying Blue, or Star Alliance - hence after 15 flights so far this year, I have still only been credited with 13 of them.",Business,4.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,5.0,February 2018,5.0,5.0,2.0,yes,New Delhi to Mumbai,5.0, |  New Delhi to Mumbai. Flying with Vistara is a different experience altogether. Flying in UK963 from New Delhi to Mumbai was good. The staff was friendly. Even the flight attendants were helpful. Food option was both Veg and Non Veg servings. Local delicacies were served during the flight which is unique to Vistara. The plane was clean and tidy. The only con for the flight was a lack of In flight entertainment.,Business,4.0,1.0

It was slightly more expensive than budget options, but offered a wonderful snack (a large samosa and a chocolate muffin), a cup of decent coffee, and a small water bottle, all for free. It was a bit unexpected and very delicious. All staff had great manners and I felt very comfortable, despite seats that were a little weak on cushioning. Would recommend.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I was travelling with my infant daughter alone and this fact was taken note of right from the entry gate of Ranchi airport to exiting the gate of New Delhi Airport. The airport staff and cabin crew members were co-operative throughout. I am a frequent flyer, this has been the best I've experienced till now.",Family Leisure,5.0,5.0

Air hostess offered me khichdi food, after noticing that i told her that i can't eat khichdi. I believe that she understood that i don't want to eat Khichdi. So she offered me her food box, then i told her, today i can't eat rice in any form. She apologized & after some time some how she offered me some fruits & cookies to eat. Really appreciable for what she did on right time. I don't know whether airline trained air hostess for this or it was her initiative. Thanks to Vistara for such nice experience.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
Airbus A320,Economy Class,5.0,September 2017,3.0,5.0,nan,yes,Delhi to Mumbai,4.0," |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara’s service is aimed at a premium overall appeal. The website interface is smooth, although the app could be better designed. Web check-in is smooth, and you don’t need to pay extra to pre-reserve a window/aisle seat of choice. Even spot check-in is easy, bag drops are always hassle free even in busy terminals like the T3 at New Delhi. The seats have comfortable leather. Leg and knee room is among the best, and you also get a coat hanger hook. However, no in-flight entertainment is a disappointment for a premium full-service airline. The food options are changing, and still remain decent. However, they were better when Vistara began, even though they still remain better than Jet Airways and Air India. The staff is very helpful and amiable, and  offer extra pillows and blankets. This was also the only domestic flight to offer a welcome drink in the Economy Class. Vistara is the best domestic airline in India in terms of quality, hospitality, cleanliness. The only thing really off-putting are the very few flights that they have right now even on popular routes, and the lacklustre Club Vistara membership programme.",Business,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,November 2017,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Hyderabad to Delhi,5.0," |  My parents travelled this morning with Vistara from Hyderabad to Delhi with connection to London via a different airline. The connection time we had between two flights was only 1 and half hours and we were made aware that the luggage had to be collected in Delhi and then checked-in again in the other airlines to London. As my parents were travelling for the first time, they started panicking as they do not have enough time to collect the luggage, got to the other airline desk for check-in , immigration and to the gate. But Vistara Airlines helped and checked in the luggage in business class so their luggage would come first and they can collect immediately when they come out.  They made my parents feel comfortable during that flight and arranged staff to assist them to reach the other flight on time with best support an airline can offer. Hats off to Team Vistara for such amazing support. ",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

They offered bunch of drinks. All were non-alcoholic though. I wish the seats were better, considering it's premium economy. The aircraft looked like old. May be they have leased it from other airline or agency. Overall it was good, and will fly again.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,3.0,July 2018,5.0,3.0,2.0,yes,Delhi to Chennai,5.0," |  Delhi to Chennai left almost 45 minutes late. Thereafter there was congestion at the runway at the take off point. Further ahead,the seat belt sign was not switched off for another 45 minutes after take off siting bad weather. Thus it must have been almost two hours from the time one reported to the boarding gate till the time the seat belt sign was switched off. I was traveling with my elderly parents in their eighties who wanted to go to the wash room about 20 minutes after the flight took off but were not allowed. However, the flight attendants wheeled in the food trolleys and started serving food during that time when the seat belt sign was still on. Other than this issue, the staff were quite efficient and courteous. The leg room was better than other domestic airlines. The food was good and adequate and the overall experience was pleasant. Another, irritant pertains to the prevalent norm in Chennai wherein the staff who assist with the wheel chair haggle over receiving a hefty tip . Overall traveling for the first time with Vistara was a good experience.",Family Leisure,5.0,2.0

I have travelled a lot in last 2 years and have flown each of the Indian airlines, but Vistara is the best among all. For foreign travellers I recommend that if you want to travel within India, use this airline. The food was good, plus the aircraft was well maintained and clean. ",Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0
A320-200,Premium Economy,5.0,May 2018,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,Kolkata to Delhi,5.0," |  Kolkata to Delhi. I am a Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and have been so for two years now. Therefore my bias for this airline is obvious.  Vistara is the only Indian domestic airline which offers Premium Economy. Same 3+3 layout as Economy but with more generous legroom. Their Economy seats have a pitch of 31"" and recline of 3.5"" except the cramped last row. The Premium Economy seats have a pitch of 33"" and recline of 4.5"". Those extra couple of inches does make a huge difference. Reached Kolkata airport at about 6 am for my 7.05 am flight to Delhi. Had checked in online the previous night. Being a Platinum Member they offer complimentary lounge access. However, as happens often, there never is time to pop into the lounge. Went straight through security and to the boarding gate. Vistara boarding is always an organised affair. I really can't put a finger on what they do different but there never is the kind of melee that you see around boarding gates of most other airlines. They started boarding at 6.24 am. We were bussed to a distant stand. Quite a few minutes of bus ride. To a very far stand beyond the old terminal building. Now, if I have one complain with Vistara and indeed with most other airlines, is that the first flight out of the day is always from a non-aerobridge stand. The planes that come in late on the previous night are parked at stands away from the terminal. Every airline that does that, seems to avoid the expenditure of getting the aircraft to an aerobridge gate for the first flight out the next morning. Instead they subject you to an uncomfortable crowded bus ride. Vistara also does the same. Boarding was quick and orderly. The welcoming cold towel (hot in winters) is always a nice touch. Then they handed over the breakfast menu. Another nice touch. A round of water. Boarding complete and doors close at 6.50 am, well before scheduled 7.05 am departure. Then the Government owned Kolkata Airport's inefficiency took over. It wasn't till 7.06 am that we were pushed back. And another 10 mins odd before we were airborne. 20/25 mins on the ground after doors closed? I don't know who is to be blamed. I always enjoy the new planes, nice clean interiors, comfortable seats, the rather different purple and gold colour scheme. Even the cabin crew wear a purple and gold uniform. I always see the lady cabin crews wearing a similar metallic gold watch and pearl ear studs which go very well with the purple uniform. Haven't seen any other airline standardising the accessories that go with the uniform. That's a real neat touch. 30 mins into the flight and it was breakfast time. Meals are always a pleasure on Vistara. I am a hardcore non vegetarian but could not resist the Sabudana Khicdi and Medu Vada in Sambhar that morning with Starbucks coffee. Awesome. We were over Delhi well in time but were then a victim to the usual early morning congestion that's routine at Delhi. Inspite of that we were on the ground a couple of minutes earlier than the scheduled 9.25 am arrival. Aerobridge connected quickly and I was off the aircraft at 9.34 am. Very happy. Vistara seems to be setting a new bench mark in Indian domestic aviation. I sure do hope they maintain that standard.",Business,4.0,nan

Secondly, this airline is yet to be accommodated at the main airport, hence their flights land at a remote location, from where they stuff you in buses and get to the airport. Thirdly, drivers of these buses are ill mannered and untrained, despite it being very hot and supremely humid he refused to put the air conditioning on, despite all the passengers requesting, screaming and someone on the verge of fainting. Fourthly, delay in getting our luggage, it’s been over 40 minutes since we landed but no sign of our luggage! Never ever flying Vistara on this sector!",Business,3.0,nan

Had to then send a reluctant guard to call someone with a wheelchair. After that the flight was smooth. Check in and boarding etc all okay. Flight on time and they served a nice snack. Return was good with the flight on time and the Vistara service once again excellent. The crew on board and service is very good.

The flight got delayed by 3 hours approximately. I received sms regularly notifying me that the flight was delayed. We were offered meals at the airport, one move to compensate for the delay caused by them, which if you are travelling by any other airline, won't even offer a glass of water or juice. After entering the flight, the decor amazed me. We were again offered an in-flight meal, both the meals were delicious. Until the flight got ready for departure, every passenger received a personalised apology letter and to make up for this we were offered 10% discount vouchers for our next travel. I am sure any other airline wouldn't have even apologised for any delay. After getting down at Mumbai, my luggage got swapped with another flyer, the immediate response of the ground staff was commendable, they traced the customer and immediately and got the bags exchanged.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

The seats even in economy are all upholstered leather with winged adjustable headrests and the cabin smells good and was cleaned thoroughly before we boarded even given the short time the cleaning staff got to clean the aircraft. The cabin crew gave all pax a snack box with a juice, hot cutlet, chapati, cookies, face wipes, tomato ketchup and a bottle of water which was all very tasty. All in all it a wonderful experience. They lack IFE which I think should be added soon and should be a must once they go international.",Business,5.0,nan

A320,Business Class,5.0,September 2016,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,GOI to BOM,4.0, |  Goa to Mumbai. Air Vistara aircraft are new with well-maintained interiors. Business Class product provides comfort and efficiency for flights shorter than 2 hours. In-flight service is outstanding as is the quality of food served. If there is one area for improvement it is that they don't yet provide wifi or any other form of entertainment. I have now flown Business Class on Vistara 3/4 times in the past year and the product has been consistent.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

A320,Premium Economy,4.0,May 2016,5.0,5.0,1.0,yes,DEL to BOM,4.0," |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara turned out to be a pleasant experience for my first flight experience. I was booked on an Economy seat and contacted on the day prior to departure with an offer to purchase Premium Economy service at INR 3,000 per seat which was a good deal. Check-in staff at both New Delhi and Mumbai airports were efficient and warm. Very engaging staff members at the dedicated counter for Premium Economy passengers. 20kg checked in baggage and airline was quite generous with cabin baggage too. Luggage was tagged as 'Priority'. Premium Economy Passengers were invited to board through a dedicated lane at both airports. The fleet is maintained new, smells good and appears clean. Cabin crew were friendly, but like most Indian flight attendants they were too pre-occupied with their checks and service formalities and the graciousness of the flight attendants of Singapore Airlines was lacking. Nevertheless, the flight attendants seemed to be far ahead of their other Indian counterparts. Leg room in Premium Economy was definitely enhanced with what appeared to be a 35"" seat pitch. No in-flight entertainment on board, yet. Their in-fight magazine indicated that wireless streaming of entertainment is scheduled to launch shortly. Ample and interesting reading material was available on board. In-flight service included warm towels and great food presented well. On arrival at both airports, it was interesting to note that all the bags that came out first had the Priority Tag on. They seem to take their Priority tag business very seriously. Vistara is an excellent product in the Regional Indian Market and they have all the makings of a Skytrax 4 to 5 Star rating. The airline makes their competition looking like a bunch of novices in the business.",Business,5.0,1.0

The aircraft are new, cabins and restrooms clean and well-maintained. The onboard staff provides excellent service. Special attention is paid to the food served (at least in Business Class). The menu card lists the calories of every item on offer. In my experience, Vistara is currently the best domestic airline in India, and by far. If inflight wifi is provided it would round off the package beautifully.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

Every aspect of this flight from check-in to boarding to in-flight service to baggage retrieval was faultless. The staff are well-groomed, efficient and warm.

The flight was ahead of schedule. The aircraft was the newest one and was clean. The boarding was done in a professional manner. Business, Premium Economy and then Economy. The seats are best in comfort especially if one is looking for a night flight. The meal options were nice and I loved the fact they were quite thoughtful as travellers prefer to have something light and not too spicy. The meal was accompanied with orange juice followed by coffee/tea service.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

My laptop trolley bag was 8kg and I was harassed to check in the luggage and not taking it by hand. I requested to their manager as well that this is the only bag and I have my laptop in bag, but of no use, they said either pay extra money or check in the baggage. Finally I have to take my laptop in my hand and check in the baggage. When tried to log in feedback at their site then their site doesn't take any feedback. Attached herewith the snapshot of the same. Never expected such an unprofessional behaviour from airlines like Vistara. Although I am a member of club Vistara as well, but still of no use.",Business,1.0,1.0

It was a wonderful experience and definitely better than i've ever had on any 50 minutes flight previously. I have to say Vistara is better than the North American carriers i've flown with.

Ground Service at Hyderabad easy, no hassle check in, boarding was reasonable and was done in about 20 minutes from first call. Seat: 9A - no recline seat - ok for a short flight, decent legroom and cushioning. Not a fan of the Vistara colour scheme though. Cabin Crew were all very conscientious and courteous. I am impressed with the quality of their training and attention to detail. Catering: Vegetarian option. Quite average tasting, a little bland. Disembarking & Luggage: Smooth landing, 7-8 min to taxi to apron in DEL. Very long walk from aerobridge to luggage belt. Luggage was ready by the time I got to the belt.

A320,Economy Class,2.0,October 2016,2.0,4.0,nan,no,GAU to DEL,4.0," | Guwahati to Delhi with Vistara. Took a last minute flight so had to pay a lot but it wasn't a very good experience. The positives - decent ground staff, better than many airlines and leg space was better than regular low cost airline carriers. However, cabin staff couldn't speak proper English and forget smiling faces. Everything felt temporary. From the ground staff (outsourced) or the old leased planes. Food and beverages offered can extract a maximum value of 500INR on the ticket price. You could spend 500INR and get a much better meal in any of the other airline carriers. Their entire gameplay is premium but nothing spelt premium to me. At least in regular economy class. The flight was mid-afternoon and it became quite warm in the flight. Adding to the heat was the seats which were leather. We kept asking the flight attendants to reduce the temperature but to no avail. Basically, a really bad experience.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

I was not provided with any other alternate flight so had to book about three days before departure and it cost me a bomb. On the contrary my parents flew from Delhi to Goa by SpiceJet in February. At that time too, SpiceJet cancelled the flight but they provided us with an alternate flight which was great on their part. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Flight 744 was departing Srinagar at 06.10 PM, reaching Delhi by 07.35 PM. The connecting flight from Delhi to Bangalore (811) was to depart at 06.45 AM the next day. My travel Booking was from Srinagar to Bangalore under a single PNR. But Srinagar ground staff gave me boarding passes to Delhi only. Added to that they booked the checked in baggages to Delhi only. They wanted me to collect the luggages at Delhi, do a fresh check in for Bangalore flight. They did not allow the transfer facility at Delhi. I was inconvinienced a lot. We were a senior citizen couple. Repeated request to the Ground staff and the airport Manager at Srinagar fell on deaf ears. In future, I would avoid travelling by Vistara.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan

I am impressed with its frequent flyer programme where the points accrued seem to be more than other airlines. Staff are courteous and the systematic boarding gives a feel good factor right from the beginning of the journey. Food served is nice and hot.

While boarding the aircraft we were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew and always had had a smile on their faces which also kept on realising that we were on board a TATA Sons airline. The interior was fantastically decorated as well as well-maintained. The seats had a very soft cushioning which made us feel very comfortable. This was the first Indian airline whose seats were made up of leather. The legroom was also nice. The food tasted fantastic. I am very eager to fly Internationally with them.

First of all the flight was brought forward although this was due to restrictions in Delhi rather than Vistara's fault. Then because I had paid using an international credit card upon checking they said they would have to verify it before they could issue my boarding pass! I have never encountered this before so had to wait for about 15 minutes before they came and gave it to me. The flight itself took off and arrived some 45 minutes behind schedule. Seating was better than on Jet Airways domestic economy and the food served was OK for a short journey. Vistara seem to be offering a good product but it wasn't quite the positive experience I was hoping for.,Business,3.0,nan
