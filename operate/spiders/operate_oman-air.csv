We were able to use the excellent Malaysia Airlines lounge at KL. Boarding was efficient and the welcome on board was warm. Our window seats were very comfortable, fully lie-flat but perhaps a little narrow. The meal choices were extensive and the quality was good. Muscat airport was uncrowded and easy to move through, and the lounge was spacious and pleasant. While the first flight operated on time, the second flight had a 90-minute delay, for reasons explained by the captain once we boarded. The aircraft had what looked like an older cabin -- more roomy and with much more storage, but with a more dated feel. The service was a little more hit and miss. Overall the flights were extremely good value for the fare paid.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

We were served good quality food. Entertainment system was average, there were not many options for movies etc but they had some new choices. Flight crew on both legs of the journey were very helpful and caring as I was travelling with my 3-year-old son. Both aircraft were pretty new and maintained well but there is need to improve the quality of food to 4 or 5 star standards. I will travel on Oman Air again, but only if they improve the ground staff service quality and airport security, otherwise you may travel with any other airline from Middle East then Oman Air.",Family Leisure,4.0,3.0

Both flights operated on time. The private lounge at Malpensa was very comfortable and not crowded, but with limited food and drink options. On both flights the service was friendly and efficient. Aboard the A330 the food was copious and excellent, and the seats were comfortable and gave a good night's rest. At Muscat the new lounge was extremely comfortable, not at all crowded and with a variety of very tasty food - the best Business Class lounge I have experienced (alcoholic drinks were not available as it was Ramadan). Our onward B737 flight to Nairobi was more basic - old-style Business Class seats with IFE screens stowed in the armrest. The food was fine - no alcohol was offered on this flight (perhaps because of Ramadan), but some passengers apparently knew it could be obtained by asking. Business passengers were bussed to the terminal first, and their luggage came out first - very impressive.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 737 800,Economy Class,5.0,May 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Chennai to Muscat,4.0, |  Chennai to Muscat. I travelled Oman Air after a gap of a few years. I chose Oman Air as I had to make an onward connection to Doha. I was amazed by my experience. Ground handling was super smooth. Aircraft was supremely neat and clean. Crew were hospitable and very helpful. In flight service was excellent. Transit was well managed though the lounge was a bit crowded. Onward flight to Doha was good as well.,Business,4.0,nan

Flight was operated by Boeing 787 business class. Its the best business class cabin compared to A330-300 which I flew before. Meals and IFE was awesome and they have wide choice of regional language entertainment. They had a wide choice of decent menu and cabin crew were extra polite and excellent service. The ground staff also were very helpful. 100% recommended airline with no delay in both onward and return journey. The return flight from MCT to DXB was operated in Boeing 737 Max which is a super silent aircraft.

I prefer the old Oman Air business class seats and cabin configuration, which is much more spacious than the new - somewhat crammed - 2-2-2. Seats comfortable on both planes. If stretched out into the bed position even the 2-2-2 of the 787 gives enough privacy. IFE of excellent technical quality with a somewhat dated movie selection. Impressive printed menu, and food and drinks were excellent. But on both flights I did not get my choice from the menu. On the way out they had even run out of all but one option of starters and main when it was my turn to order. I was not sitting in the last business cabin row. Staff very friendly, very helpful but - again as usual at Oman Air - sometimes disturbingly loud in the galley during their off times.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,May 2018,3.0,1.0,4.0,no,Salalah to London  via Muscat,3.0," |  Salalah to London  via Muscat. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service, on the ground by check in staff as well as the cabin crew. Unfortunately we experienced a 12 hour delay due to a late arriving flight causing us to miss our connection. These things do happen - but this was not the worst of the problem. We received no apology from the airline and after wandering around trying to find someone to help us, we were treated as though this was our problem. After speaking to the customer service desk in Muscat and waiting a further 15 minutes for an Oman Air service supervisor she explained that we would go to a hotel and wait until the next flight. This supervisor was extremely rude. We were not allowed to take our luggage to the hotel - so there really wasn't much point in a hotel as we couldn't freshen up or use the facilities. The hotel was disgusting anyway so wouldn't have used it regardless. With myself and my partner paying £800 between us, I am shocked this is the best they can offer. We were not allowed any drinks other than juice, unless you wanted to pay extra as the airline would not cover this. The best thing about the airline was the in flight entertainment - but don't expect to be able to watch it as there are constant  announcements,  in three different languages. We flew overnight and hoped we would be able to sleep throughout. This was not possible with the constant announcements and being woken up for breakfast at 1am when the flight did not arrive until 4.30. I  would never fly with this airline again.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
A330-200 & Boeing 737-900,Economy Class,2.0,May 2018,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,London to Kozhikode via Muscat,4.0, | Flights mainly on time and the Y class section on the A330 aircraft is above average in quality with a 34 inch seat pitch. 737 Y class poor with very firm seat. The airline is mainly let down by a large number of the crew being disinterested e.g. on the outbound 7 hour leg only doing the rounds for beverages on two occasions this is not normal for a flight of this length. Some crew do go above and beyond but the airline clearly has issues overall with the crew performance that needs to be addressed. Overall though due to the above average seating on the A330 I would say the experience was quite positive despite the crew being the carriers weak link.,Business,3.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,A flight by my partially sighted and physically disabled brother from LHR to Bangkok via Muscat. Caught in the snow at Heathrow eventually he was put on a flight on 22nd December to Muscat in Business class. The ground support and handling throughout the journey was good allowing full access to ground facilities. Business class passengers helped with food toilet and access in the cabin. However due to the design of the A330 multimedia and visual signalling within the cabin was not available. The second leg of this flight was economy class. Again the ground handling seemed very good. However the staff seemed very inexperienced in seat selection and he was placed somewhere in the middle of the cabin. This meant that he could not access the toilet on board without the group effort of some 20 passengers to navigate the cabin. He was trapped in the toilet once there as it was not apparent how to unlock the door. The food was wrapped in dark plastic sealed containers which could not be accessed by a partially sighted person resulting some 5 hours plus with no water food disorientated unable to call for help and restricted access for disabled aids despite requests for a suitable seat location 1 week earlier.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Bangkok to Paris had technical problem in Bangkok and maintenance could not fix it and we had to spend a night at Bangkok. From the moment we left the plane to the following morning at the airport Oman Air staff was invisible and we only had information from the Bangkok airport crisis number (witch is very efficient). The following morning Oman Air told us we would take off at 1130am and spend a 23hr transit at Muscat before taking our second plane to France. The technical problem had not been fixed and we had to change for another plane. We arrived Muscat at 630pm instead of 230pm. Baggage didn't follow. As in Bangkok we didn't meet any Oman Air staff in the hotel and had great difficulty to collect information. Our plane to Paris took of on time but we arrived at destination with a 36 hours delay. Due to those awful conditions I think Oman Air's staff was not very helpful. A french speaking mediator in Muscat and a better coordination between the company and hotels where we spent the 2 nights would have been helpful (60 people were concerned).,nan,1.0,nan

Food okay and IFE comprehensive - although the free headphones are about as cheap as you can get. Punctuality was good on all sectors and Muscat is a pleasant environment to wait for a connection. I do have one issue though. I appreciate Oman is an Islamic state and some of the cabin crew probably do not approve of alcohol. But on the first leg LHR-MCT when my partner developed a headache and asked for a paracetamol she was told that she couldn't have one as she had been drinking alcohol! Yes she had had a 330ml of Fosters and one 18.5ml bottle of red wine in the previous 6 hours but to deny a customer a painkiller on these grounds is ridiculous and poor customer care. Then on the return flight from Muscat I requested a Gin and Tonic and was told there was no Gin on board - this was about 30mins after leaving Muscat. I think Oman air need to decide whether they are going to be a dry Islamic airline a point of view I would respect or have a liberal Western attitude to reasonable alcohol consumption.",nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,LHR-MCT-BKK return. Having booked well in advance was annoyed to receive email informing us of schedule change (don't Oman know their schedules for the year?) with two options : cut short trip by three days or extend by one. No offer to compensate for either loss of holiday or extension expense. Online check in is a farce only one sector can be checked in and a seat selected. Ended up row 23 LHR-MCT but row 44 MCT-BKK. Same on the reverse journey row 23 BKK- MCT row 44 MCT-LHR. Of the 8 flights with Oman on this route in the past six months IFE has worked only once. Crew range from attentive to disinterested. Food has taken a nose dive in the last six months. MCT-LHR flight at least 7 rows were denied a drinks service as a 'senior' staff member resented being told she had forgotten to do it and sulked. For the first time ever had to use the call button to ask for a drink with meal and get IFE reset after a promise to rectify went undone. Have used Oman Air's OnAir product successfully once. Good wifi speed but at $29.95 its very expensive. Decided to treat ourselves to OnAir on the MCT-LHR (longest leg). Worked fine for 20 minutes then crashed and crew couldn't have cared less.

The cabin crew seemed to spend most of their time talking among themselves. Four staff for 16 passengers but little interaction and no customer service.

Inflight service food IFE and crew all positive. On arrival into KUL my bag had been lost and this is where the airline and my entire experience fell down. The local staff were not readily on hand and certainly made very little effort once tracked down. It took about 36 hours to receive my bag and the promised delivery times were seemingly mere fabrications since they came and went on two occasions without any sign of my bags so all this did was to further build upon my frustrations. As a full fare paying premium passenger I expect an airline to jump into action when things go wrong and there was absolutely none of that. All contact was initiated by me at great expense and the airline failed to take a single pro-active step to manage the situation or reputation. Eventually I realized that they knew my bag was delayed by 24hrs even before I arrived into KUL but simply failed to take any action on the information. So a pleasurable experience turned very sour because the airline did not appear to have control interest or regret when something went wrong. The entire approach including the subsequent lack of interest from the head office leads me to question how serious this airline really is about competing within the region.,nan,4.0,nan

After 6 hours they drove us by bus to a desk (still inside the airport) where we were supposed to receive a temporary visa. We had to deal ourselves with the staff who didn't believe that we were told to leave the airport.

nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,Third time flying Paris-Kuala Lumpur via Muscat in business class. Service was excellent and the seats comfortable with a lot of space and privacy. Oman Air's business class cabin offers comfort and space which could rival many airlines' first class cabin. Fare for this trip very competitive. Happy with the service. However all business class passengers should be offered the limousine service as advertised on their website. Secondly while in transit in Muscat passengers should not have to go through another security check and if so there should be a priority lane for premium passengers. The last few trips the security checks were fairly quick as there weren't many passengers but when you have a rather short transit time this can be a source of anxiety. On my return trip via Muscat the plane landed 25-30 minutes late and I was anxious in case I had to go through a long queue in security. However the crew reassured me and as it happens there was no queue. Thirdly for trips to and from Malaysia it would be a good idea to add some Malay cuisine to the menu. Finally dining should be on demand in business class and there should be an option to order from a menu online prior to departure this will avoid disappointment of the crew running out of your choice on the menu. For example on the first leg from Paris they ran out of sea bass on the business class menu.,nan,5.0,nan

Nice interior and comfortable seats. Both flights were very punctual in fact my flight arrived into DXB twenty minutes ahead of schedule. For a very competitive price I would not mind booking WY again even if it involves backtracking (overall adds just an hour over flying QR or GF). I do feel however that the airline focuses more on the flagship routes to Heathrow KL Indian Ocean etc. when it comes to delivering a 'premium' experience.

Hot wrap snack before arrival into Muscat was just ok. Muscat airport has no jetways so buses are involved. Both sectors took no more than 10 minutes total and was well organized. The airport was fine though the Duty Free seemed overly expensive but there are several decent food outlets including Costa Coffee. Flight to Munich again was half empty so we could stretch out but once again the food was just average though they gave us several bottles of wine and water.

We were the only ones in the front economy class cabin and were served within 10 minutes after take off and lights out 30 minutes later which was great as the flight leaves at 10pm. Slept 5 hours straight as we made beds from the middle section with many blankets and pillows. Better than first class! Flight from Muscat to Bangkok was 100pct full so I was now wondering what the service would be like. We had 2 seats together at the window in 2nd cabin with no room to stretch out but again the seating is great and the best economy class at 34 inches I've been in. Service was efficient and quick even with a full flight. All sectors the cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Nice towel service all flights and good amenities kits handed out on each sector. Entertainment is fine and no issues and could recharge my phone and laptop as well from any seat. My only issue was the food. Little of it and not very appetizing though on one sector the vegetarian lasagne was good. Water bottles were also handed out immediately after service on all sectors which is a great idea.

On the earlier occasion I could not fault the service and comfort with full service and convenience packs. Now the planes are older and have not been touched since new with the cabin fabrics showing signs of hard wear over the last 5-6 years threadbare and stained in places. The footrest (unnecessary) kept flopping down restricting leg space. When you do use it it puts your legs in an unnatural position. Just take them out! The toilets were also shabby. There were so many in flight announcements that watching a film was like commercial TV with adverts. Those were the bad bits. Overall the service is still worth taking as it represents excellent value on this route compared with other Middle East airlines. The leg room is an unrivalled 34"" connection times minimal and a 30kg baggage allowance means I can take all my sports equipment with me. The bonus is if you are travelling as a couple or father/son as I did the two seats close to the window really provide a comfort zone in the A330 (2-4-2 as opposed to the 3-4-3 configuration on 777's flown by the other Middle Eastern operators and EVA).

There is no separate queue for business class. On board the flight was exceptionally comfortable. However it was a day flight and given 90 minutes a queuing after a long flight to KL and hours in the airport it was not worth paying the business class fare. Oman is a nice place to visit and they run a large tourist promotion effort in Australia but they really must fix the transit at KL.

A complete joke and not a single apology by the staff as I stood waiting. The Oman Air lounge is nice but sadly people laying everywhere on the floor and dirty plates. It seemed the staff were intimidated by the passengers. Onboard I felt I was not a guest or passenger but a nuisance. Oman Air use to be amazing. The food service but now the complete opposite.

I just have a few points to make that could improve their service. Limousine service should be part of the deal when flying business class dining should be on demand and flights to Kuala Lumpur should give a choice of Malay cuisine. The short connection time in Muscat can be a source of anxiety as passengers need to go through security again and there is no priority lane for business class passengers. The last few times there was hardly any wait at security so that was fine but should there be a delay I hope Oman Air can guarantee that passengers will not miss their connection flight.

Flying to and from Muscat to Salalah they keep changing the departure times 3 times and although they sort of inform you it is almost impossible to understand whether it has really changed or not. This of course means ones onward flights are compromised. Even our friends in Muscat say now they will only fly Oman Air as a last resort. What a pity many of the ingredients are there to make it an excellent airline but it just seems to be going downhill.

This is the first time I have used Oman I usually use Etihad or Emirates but I probably wont chose Oman again until they open the new airport in Muscat. The reason been there are no airbridges to get on and off the plane they use busses. This makes boarding a lot longer sat in a waiting area with no toilets or any facilities Also as the plane is at a remote stand there is no air conditioning until take off and with 300 passengers sat waiting at 45C it is unbearable making it very uncomfortable. 3 times I had to ask for a coffee the service was a hit and miss too.

For instance the soap dispenser since my first trip was so dirty that soap has oozed out around the nozzle and remained the same when I flew the same flight two weeks later. The food quality has dropped and is not how it was the year before. The entertainment package onboard needs to be improved and additional options such as movies to be added.

But actually a very pleasant experience on board: as 2-4-2 format had pre-booked window and aisle seats - plenty of legroom and very comfortable with pillows and blankets in each seat. Excellent IFE - modern THALES system - but perhaps a better choice of films could be provided. Take your own headphones - mine worked fine once I figured out how to position the jack in the rather odd socket. Decent service with pre meal beer and individual bottle of wine with the absolutely outstanding meal (especially for economy) on outbound flight - not quite so good on return.

The second flight to Trivandrum was also good and we were served a delicious Indian fish curry. The return flight from Muscat to London was a different story. The food was atrocious. Tough Beef and the other choice was pasta and only pasta in a tomato sauce. That said the breakfast warm egg wrap was better. On all flights the toilets were very clean and smelt of detergent.

There was not much difference in the price in relation to two other reputed Middle Eastern carriers which I have flown before (always had very good experience with).

As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move.

The check-in staff at Kuala Lumpur were ridiculously slow and said nothing to us when we finally reached the counter. I have never experienced a 'silent check-in' before. As she handed us our boarding passes, she said: 'Gate C4. 9 o'clock'. That was the entire extent of her vocabulary. No smile, no 'have a nice flight', nothing. The cabin crew on the Kuala Lumpur-Muscat sector were the surliest I have ever encountered. Even the basics were carried out without cheer and with looks of utter disinterest and irritation. The child's meal we requested for our daughter did not materialise, and the flight attendant immediately assured us that this was because we hadn't actually booked one. On showing her the booking, she instantly blamed the caterers, saying they 'didn't deliver the correct number of meals'. No hint of an apology at any stage. The in-flight meals were surprisingly average and these were delivered hurriedly and without a smile .The seats were excellent though. The 34 inch seat pitch is one of the best and the width and recline were both very good. IFE easy to use and had a good selection for all ages. The crew on the Muscat-Milan Malpensa were absolutely brilliant. I mentioned the child meal issue after boarding and the flight attendant immediately sorted it out. Friendly, helpful and welcoming. This crew could not have been more different from the unpleasant team on the first sector. Oman Air has serious issues with their Malpensa flights however. Every single day for the last 2 weeks, WY 143 has departed Muscat in excess of an hour late (and often much later than that). We felt lucky to arrive in Milan at 20 25, just 60 minutes behind schedule! I would recommend Oman Air for the excellent legroom and wide seats, but their inconsistent level of service needs to be remedied.

Our flight was two hours late, most of which time we spent sitting on the plane with no refreshments offered. The delay was due to the flight paperwork not being in order, so Muscat had to be contacted to arrange this - surprising such a fundamental item wasn't organised correctly. Because of the delay, we only just made our onward flight, which was overbooked so we were upgraded, but anyone arriving after us didn't get on the flight. We turned out to be not so lucky when our luggage did not follow us to Delhi until the following day. No one at the airport seemed that interested and said our cases would be on the next day's flight. When they arrived at our hotel at 7pm, one case was ripped badly and the other had been broken into, the lock disappeared and the contents rifled through. The service company replaced the damaged case at Heathrow. Really would not recommend Oman Air, as know of someone else whose case was delayed on return from Delhi However, good seat pitch and recline, and cabin crew helpful",Family Leisure,3.0,nan

I was not expecting much from my flight experience but the planes I flew on were the modern versions, good seat pitch, excellent IFE. The cabin crew were very efficient in what they did - as said by many, you don't see them that much during the flight. But as with any long journey on a plane it is good to stretch your legs, so you walk down to the galley for any extra drinks you want. The food was not to my taste but it was perfectly edible - they do offer alcoholic drinks before your meal and with your meal - if you want more after that you have to use your call button or walk to the galley. Transit was very straightforward, no walkways direct off the plane, you are coached to/from the plane. A new airport is being constructed which will have these amenities. Terminal itself is ok for passengers, 2hrs free WiFi, selection of overpriced shops/eateries. All of my flights arrived early.

This time had taken this airline just to try the Boeing 787 on DXB-MCT. I must say it turned out to be a very comfortable flight. The only issue was that the IFE did not work as system was down. On the 737 for BOM-MCT: very comfortable seats, good legroom, great IFE and relaxing on-board ambiance. For the crew, they are polite and good. However, very reserved. Food onboard was reasonable, but disappointed with the fruit platter I ordered. Let down as opposed to what competition offers, Transit was alright, As I had lounge access.

Overall the service on board for all our flight sectors was really good. Flight attendants were friendly, warm and helpful. Food and entertainment were OK, nothing to complain about. Seats in our flight from FRA to Muscat and Muscat to Kuala Lumpur had a spacious legroom, even with my husband's long legs he had no problem stretching them. As for our return flights Kuala Lumpur to Muscat and Muscat to FRA, legrooms are tight and those with long legs had to suffer the whole journey. Besides tight legrooms, the entertainment system were all fully touch screen control and every time the passenger behind me touching his screen, my seat being pushed forward, which disturbed me big time especially when I was trying to sleep. It would be better if a hand held controller is being used. One small glitch happened during our flight from Muscat to FRA. We were being transported from boarding lounge to the plane by a bus after a long wait at the lounge. When the bus reached the plane, the cleaning works were not done and all of us were being locked inside the bus for like 40 mins and the air-conditioning were not functioning well.

A330,Economy Class,5.0,June 2016,2.0,3.0,2.0,yes,LHR to SIN via MCT,3.0,"This was the return flight. Flying Oman Air saved us money, but I'd also read very decent reviews and the timings weren't too bad so it was an obvious choice. Overall, from a cost perspective, it was worth it. Oman Air is perfectly decent, although there were some IFE and food issues. On the way out from Singapore to London Heathrow we chose the 13 hour stop in Muscat so we could get a rest in a hotel (we were traveling with a three year old). This was easy enough, but as our son didn't cooperate it just added more time onto an exhausting journey. On the way back we had the simple one-hour change in Muscat, which was simple and quick enough. On both flights the Kuala Lumpur stop of around an hour was simple enough, and on the way back the flight crew let my son see the cockpit - something I've not experienced since (I think) 1980. There were IFE problems on both legs - usually frozen touch screens, or language options that resisted being set to anything but German. This was a major problem, although the ability to use the IFE even when on the ground was useful. The other big issue was the food on the flight back, in the middle of Ramadan. There wasn't much of a service from LHR (I'd have expected a meal on take off at 2050), but the real problem was Muscat - KL/SG. I can only imagine that Ramadan meant that the kitchens in Muscat were barely working, as the food was pretty grim and sporadic (most passengers were Muslim and busy fasting until the end of the flight). The cabin crew were good. Two stand out. One helped me secure a spare couple of seats at the very back, giving my wife and son a bit more space in the centre seats. When I asked for a wine she answered with, ""One? Two? Three? Just two? Then just ask if you want more."" That is excellent and grown up. The other was very friendly and helped out a lot, especially when my son vomited during the extremely bumpy 6 or so hours almost from take off in Muscat to the coast of Malaysia (monsoon season in the Indian Ocean), and got my son onto the flight deck. As an airline, then, it's not a top offering, but with plenty to recommend it if you want to save cash. I also hear that Oman is excellent for exploring if you have time.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan

In my opinion, the Oman Air A330 with the configuration 2-4-2 is one of the top economy class - I would risk to say that it was better than Emirates A380 economy class.

Despite great choice of films and games for kids always touch screen problems, we had to change headphones 2 times, the connectors between headphones and the system. The crew was trying to help but the screens were simply broken. Good thing the flights were not full so we could change the seats. Muscat Airport is a very small and basic (new one has been built and it is a matter of months when they move in to the new premises - it looks very impressive from outside).

Muscat airport still does not have air bridges even though their airport is now over 2 years behind the official opening date, which means that you have to walk up and down stairs and be transported by bus to and from the plane. The cabin crew were very good, the food and drinks only so-so. Muscat to MNL was also on an A330 but with new seating layout, 2-2-2, which I think is a backwards step, but then they can get more bodies on board by using this layout and one has to remember that airlines are not being run for the benefit of passengers but as a business enterprise to make a profit. Food and drinks were also average on this flight, CC were all good, I didn't need to ring the bell as they seemed to anticipate all of my needs, the only 2 criticisms that I have to make is that you have to eat when they want to feed you and not on demand like some other middle eastern airlines offer, also that they only serve you neat drinks, no cocktails etc available. Did not have time to try their lounge in Muscat due to very short 1hour 40 minutes layover time which was shortened by having to use buses to and from the planes, otherwise if they have air bridges I would recommend them especially for their low prices.

Boeing 787,Business Class,4.0,July 2017,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes,Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat,5.0," |  Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Top notch airline, round trip flights in the three different cabins available for long haul, old business class, new suite business class and business class seats in leased planes from Kenyan Airways. Oman Air product ranks higher in terms of comfort and privacy than the Kenyan leased one. Avoid if possible leased planes are seat confort and privacy are a downgrade on Oman Air product. Service was outstanding, particular food, cabin staff usually from Asia and Oman for steward and on par with other carriers in the region and Asia. Connecting flights in muscat are hassle free as airport is small (new terminal by end year) and allow for little connecting time. Lounge in muscat is ok but no real shower facilities, shower spot in the toilets only. Overall, one of the best experience in terms of cabin confort and appearance and value for money, and service. Oman Air is a medium size carrier, and while that does bring some benefits in terms of customer service and experience, the network is limited but expanding. if booked in advance their business saver fare are half the price of market average which makes it the best value rate for business from europe to asia. few negatives, perhaps the lack of consistency in service and frequent flyer scheme not integrated in the main global schemes. Strongly recommend it.",Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0
A330,First Class,4.0,July 2017,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes,London to Muscat,4.0," |  I've been collecting miles and points from BA for decades and this is the first flight where I have switched to another airline because of the cuts. Oman Air compared favourably. The limo service at both ends helped, of course. The staff on board were excellent and friendly. The Champagne is Cristal and there are only six seats in first. The food was disappointing, in line with BA. The only negative was a rude staffer in the Oman Air office before departures in Muscat. She barely raised her eyes from checking her mobile phone to tell me she couldn't help me, almost sneering. But her two colleagues over-compensated and were very helpful. I've marked down the ground service because of her, but overall, it was a good experience.",Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0
A330,Economy Class,2.0,July 2017,2.0,2.0,3.0,no,London to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat,4.0," |  London to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat. Check-in at LHR was ok, check-in was slow as only one counter open for web check-in. Boarding fine. Flight was OK, but cabin crew lacked personality or care for passenger. My wife spilled her wine and ended have to clean the aisle herself using a blanket as cabin crew serving took no interest in helping - very poor. Muscat connection was fine if a little rushed due to having to use bus to get from plane to terminal. Second flight was slightly better but again crew were like robots and unable to deal with anything outside the normal. Food on both flights was bland and tasteless like most airlines. At least all our luggage arrived! Return flight - horrendous experience at check in at KL. Waited 45 minutes in the web check-in line before being served - again only one counter for web in was open. The normal check-in line was moving faster, but we were told to wait in web check-in line. We had earlier in the day used AirAsia and managed to check in the same luggage in 5 minutes using bag drop facility. What is the point of web check-in Oman Air? When we complained to the Oman Air staff they just looked at us with a blank expression and had no idea how to deal with the situation. Their excuse was a silver card member was checking in for their family of over 7 members (who were not present at check-in) with over 10 suitcases. If they were silver card member shouldn't they have used Business Class check-in counter? It was a terrible start to the return journey and the airline representative was completely useless and tried deflect blame - very unprofessional. Return flights were ok, but boarding was a mess as the aircraft hadn't even arrived and passengers were told to get to gate - so all passengers queued and waiting to get into gate. Flight was ok - crew a bit more personable and caring although even they were getting frustrated with some of the passengers (not used to flying). Connection in Muscat was again rushed and hectic. Last flight was fine and felt more civilised after the previous flight. Food was edible. IFE was ok, but lacked variety found on other airlines. The customer service standards were inconsistent both on the ground and in the air. Aircraft were clean and spacious and the airline is value for money - the main reason for choosing the airline. Oman Air still needs to work hard to get to the standards of Emirates and Far Eastern airlines - particularly customer services.",Family Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,July 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,London to Kuala Lumpur via Muscat,4.0," |  London to Kuala Lumpur return via Muscat. Return tickets bought via DialAFlight. DialAFlight had split me and my parents by gender, so I had to check-in four times. However, this was only made more difficult by Oman Air's confusing website. Our first flight from London is the one of four that I recall going nicely. In transit at Muscat we had to go through security, and take ride buses to board the plane.  Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, we discovered they had left one bag in Muscat, and spent an hour and a half enquiring when it would be returned. For our return, I had checked-in online to assign seats for KUL-MCT at around 1220 which would later prove to be futile. Getting our boarding passes was even more stressful. We arrived at the airport around 1930, and after speaking to the check-in staff, we were informed that all three of our names were not on register for the flight. It was only after we found this out that other passengers had the same issue. The staff checking us in tried to fix the issue which took one and a half hours, delaying the flight to 2220. We were assigned new seats that I deliberately avoided in the first place. Check-in aside, the flight was pleasant. By the time we landed in Muscat, our connecting flight to London already taken off.  We were put on the next flight which was just under 12 hours later. The airport then arranged for a night's stay at the Golden Tulip Seeb Hotel. Our seats on this flight were less than pleasant. At the very back, overhead storage space was occupied by flight supplies so our bags had to go under the seats in front of us.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

The checkin at Paris was good, Oman uses Cathay's lounge which is a decent lounge. The flight got delayed by 4.5 hours with little information from ground crew. Once we landed in Muscat having missed our connections, none of the staff knew how to deal with passengers with missed connections. People were told to go and queue at one counter only to be told to go to another counter and queue up again. It took nearly three hours to arrange a hotel and an alternative flight for me. I was very disappointed with the lack of coordination of the ground staff. I would not travel with this airline again.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

Flew Business Class recently with Oman Air from Jakarta to Frankfurt via Muscat. Seats are ok, but service and food quality is just average. Etihad has better food offering and much better service. Business Class Lounge in Muscat is also disappointing. There are only seats that are not very comfortable when you have 2 or more hours of layover. Food is also very limited. Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is much better. Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi also has better food. Muscat airport is also very small, nothing much to do, you have to get off the plane on staircase and take a shuttle bus to the airport. No cell phone coverage here in Muscat if you have Google Fiber. Overall I would not recommend flying Oman Air unless you get a much lower price than Etihad, Emirates or Turkish.

Every time there has been an issue. We have contacted Oman Air and followed their complaints procedure and have been ignored every time. We are very disappointed with the poor customer service and incompetence shown by Oman Air. Their staff are rude and unhelpful. Abu Dhabi to Melbourne via Muscat and Kuala Lumpur. Flight WY632 between Muscat and Kuala Lumpur. Our bags went missing. We filed a report at Kuala Lumpur and were assured that Oman Air would contact us within 24 hours. That never happened. We spent 5 days of a 9 day holiday without our clothes. The bags eventually turned up on the 5th day which involved a 4hr round trip to collect them. We made numerous phone calls to Oman Air during this time and staff were very unhelpful. We raised a complaint with Oman Air and received a very unhelpful reply from Customer Relations.  They ignored all of our replies to this email. We raised another complaint for which they acknowledged receipt - and then ignored. Abu Dhabi to Manchester via Muscat on 13th May 2017. Inbound flight WY634 and WY105 from Muscat to Abu Dhabi was delayed so the connecting flight from Muscat to Manchester was missed. No representatives present at the airport to help us apart from on female member of staff in a distant office dealing with all irate customers and missed connections. It took so long for her to organise that the first Etihad direct flight to Manchester was missed and the next flight was several hours later. This flight was going to London. There was a shuttle provided by BA to Manchester. When we arrived in Manchester, our bags were not there. We arrived in Manchester at 1am, Oman Air promised our bag would be delivered the following morning; they arrived at 8pm – nearly 24hr late. I also had my 7yr old son with me. Manchester to Abu Dhabi via Muscat - Flight WY633 on 18th May 2017. The flight was delayed so the connecting flight was missed. The aircraft did not make up the time during the journey and this was despite promises from Oman Air staff that the connecting flight to Abu Dhabi would wait. This incurred a 5hr wait in Muscat Airport for me and my 7yr old son. We were put on an Etihad flight. Manchester to Abu Dhabi via Muscat. Flight WY0106 on 4th June 2017. The flight was delayed so the connecting flight was missed. The aircraft did not make up the time during the journey and this was despite promises from Oman Air staff that the connecting flight to Abu Dhabi would wait.

I've flown with many many different airlines and Oman Air are the worst I've experienced for long haul. On my flight out from Heathrow, my seat sliding mechanism was broken which meant that when I stretched out the seat would slide out and backrest would fall back. I complained and nothing was done about it on the flight. On return flight, my entertainment unit didn't work. I complained, and again they didn't do anything or pretend to care. So an 8 hour flight without any form of entertainment was hell. I was suffering from a stomach bug on my way back to London and needed water because I was getting dehydrated. I got up and walk to the galley and asked nicely if I could have some water because I'm not well. I got a rude response of ""Yeah I will bring it to you"", what she really wanted to say is ""go away"". I just stood there looking at the staff until she gave me water. I've never experienced such rude service in my life on an airplane. My experience of the connecting Oman Air flights between Muscat and Goa was a complete different story. They were great, exactly what I expect from an airline. The short flights would get 5*s.

The whole process from check in to travel was average at the best. The check in facilities were so limited combined with poor bandwidth of the website, options including choosing child meals or wheelchair assistance etc were not available especially if you have bought the tickets via an agent. Again, after spending a substantial amount of time waiting for the seating options to show up on the website, most were already booked even after logging in immediately after opening of the 24hr window for check in before flying, so we ended up selecting seats in different parts of the flight which is far from ideal when travelling as a family with two young children. Neither the check in desk at departure or the transit were able to help, more disappointed and annoyed at the false information and blame game being played by the staff who were more interested in seeing us through rather than sorting out our problem. The inflight facilities were mediocre indeed with dated looking upholstery, no welcome for the kids or entertainment options for them, flights did not have TVs, when they did have televisions, most of the time touch screens do not work, headphones were as poor as one can get, did not transmit even 50% of the volume. Waited for at least 75 minutes for even water to be served in spite of asking for juice/water for the kids, meals arrived 150 minutes after boarding, again hungry irritable kids had to be managed, standard response from the staff that meals was not booked in advance, trying to explain this to the staff about the website issue was a waste of time. Again trying to explain to hungry kids needing to wait another 45 minutes after the neighbouring kids had their meals served was a challenging task. Add to this, they even missed serving us inflight snacks and drinks for the kids, I had walk to the pantry to remind them that we have not been served, no apologies, just a smile. All in all, a low cost airline which is unsuitable for longer journeys and for young families. ",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Some spoke hardly any English, some were just very slow. Food on the way out was simply insulting.

The shared lounge in London bucharest and vienna are all ok too. Oman air is an honest, down to earth option and the new airport beautiful (even if transit security is a mess, wifi needs an sms and the staff seem lost inside the new space) I'm giving them a try - as my prefered carrier in this region. A genuinely friendly option with consistently better pricing than many.",Business,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,Kuala Lumpur to Dubai via Muscat,5.0," |  Kuala Lumpur to Dubai via Muscat. First time to fly with Oman Air. Did online check in and chose a seat. However, upon boarding, the seat that i selected was blocked. I was asked to wait for almost everyone to have their seat to check on a vacant seat. Cabin crew, although nice and pleasant, were not smiling for when I interacted with them. Surprisingly, Arabic food served was tasty. InFlight entertainment was good. Seat was comfortable. Overall, it was a pleasant journey.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
A330-300,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,nan,3.0,nan,yes,London to Abu Dhabi via Muscat,3.0," |  London to Abu Dhabi via Muscat. Check in felt chaotic and disorganised. Boarding was late. Onboard a small snack was served after 45 minutes. Dinner was served 2 hours in to the flight which was past midnight UK time. I was asleep head down on the tray table, the cabin crew made several attempts to wake me for my meal which I did not appreciate. In Economy 5 toilets exist, only 2 were operational. Breakfast roll on landing was substandard. Generally cabin crew are pleasant, leg room was ample, in flight entertainment seemed okay but I did not use it. In summary Oman Air are the cheapest on some routes, I probably would fly with them again if they offered a considerable saving. However you won't get the bells and whistles. If you are looking for a cheap flight and don't care much for the food or service, this airline works just fine.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

No menu was given to us on our outbound flight and the option we chose had run out on our outbound flight. The toilet was horrendous in economy, and one of the toilet on our inbound flight had no water. Ground crew in Manchester and Dubai the greatest asset.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

After that I can say I have found a big difference from the first time flow. Really surprised how changed in less service, space seat and service. From Muscat to Milan the hostess unkind and nervous, poor service and not so good food.",Couple Leisure,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,London Heathrow to Bangalore via Muscat,2.0," | Oman Air’s website boldly states that “Flying Oman Air is only the beginning of a beautiful relationship with us. We believe customer satisfaction is of paramount importance”. A more accurate statement would be “Flying Oman Air is the beginning and the end of the shortest relationship you will ever have since customer satisfaction is not of any importance to us”. During a return journey from London to Bangalore via Muscat, four flights my wife, 1-year old son and I, encountered the following: 1) London Heathrow to Muscat: We were allocated a bassinet seat. The stewardess informed us that she would bring a bassinet for our baby shortly. She subsequently provided one to the couple beside us (who were also allocated a bassinet seat) and then informed us that they had run out of bassinets for the long-haul flight despite us sitting in a bassinet seat! 2) LHR to MCT: I was told at check-in that I would get our pushchair at the door when I get off the plane in BLR. We did not and had to carry our son until we received our luggage on the belt. This happened again on the return flight. 3) Muscat to Bangalore: Oman Air have a policy that one parent gets a free bassinet seat but the other parent has to pay a premium to sit together with the family! Outrageous! They prefer to sell the other seat as a premium seat to unsuspecting customers looking for additional leg room and comfort and are oblivious to the likelihood that they will be stuck next to a crying baby and a bassinet which hampers their legroom! 4) BLR to MCT: The check in staff (two different members of staff!) tried to sell both bassinet seats to me as premium seats before I had to explain to them their own policy! 5) BLR to MCT: Oman Air operate this ridiculous luggage policy where you can carry up to 60kg of luggage between two adults but no 2 pieces of luggage can exceed 30kg in total. This leads to unnecessary hassle and delays for both passengers and Oman Air staff. 6) MCT to LHR: Upon take-off and after the seat belt sign was turned off, we requested a bassinet for our son who had fallen asleep in the mother’s arms. The stewardess returned with a drinks tray and said: ‘just a moment’! She obviously then only returned to fix the bassinet 30 mins later once drinks had been served for the entire flight! In general, it was a battle to get any type of service from the majority of Oman Air staff. I have to say that there were a few exceptions, whose service was very much appreciated e.g. the senior steward on the LHR-MCT flight who tried to appease us despite the shoddy cards he’d been dealt with by Oman Air and one of the check in staff at BLR who helped us reshuffle our luggage. However, this was not sufficient to want us to fly Oman Air again! The only reason to fly Oman Air is if it is the cheapest option and you’re not in need of any service i.e. single traveller just looking to get from A to B!",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Wonderful experience, very friendly staff, good meals, impeccable service, comfortable seats. On some planes all seats have direct aisle access , so window seated passengers do not need jump over their neighbor.All this at an unbelievable price.
