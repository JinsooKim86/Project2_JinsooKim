The cabin crew onboard are very friendly however, much more than other European airlines I’ve flown with.  The snacks and drinks are served twice, quite unusual for a 2 hours flight, perhaps an extra service due to the delay. The plane was pleasant, seat is comfortable, enough space for cabin baggage, smooth takeoff and landing. There’s a paid wifi onboard which I didn’t purchase, quite unusual for such a short flight. Overall good value for money, other budget carriers charge around the same and would’ve given less service. If there was no delay, I would have given 10/10.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

I asked her why she was shouting at me and she said because she has asked me the same question six times. Her underling was equally rude to me and told me to “go” (meaning get on the flight). These two people do not represent the Austrian people nor the Company, and no customer deserves to be shouted at because they do not understand a question. ",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

A320 / A319 ,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,4.0,3.0,nan,yes,London to Sofia via Vienna,3.0," | London to Sofia via Vienna. Checked in online for both flights using the app, which was very easy. I had a ""Economy Light"" fare which meant cabin baggage up to 8kg plus a laptop bag or similar. This was a 06:00 departure from LHR T2. I always like to have paper boarding cards in case of phone failure so on arrival at 04:25 I went straight to a self service kiosk and got boarding cards for both sectors printed very quickly and easily. This is one of the first flights out of LHR so I was amazed I was through security and airside by 04:35. The downside about this time of day in T2 is there is absolutely nothing open until 05:00. My flight was out of the gates in the satellite building so I walked there. Boarding started just after 05:30 and was efficient, used a jet bridge and not a bus, and the staff applied a pragmatic approach to hand baggage. I had no problem stowing my wheelie bag in the overhead locker and my other bag under the seat in front. The seat pitch was acceptable and comfortable enough for a 2h15 flight. We departed approx 5 mins late, but arrived 15 mins late in VIE. Onboard service on this sector was reasonably swift in getting started and was basically beverages including alcohol plus a muffin. There was a second beverage service later into the flight. The flight attendants were all friendly and helpful. Arrival at VIE, which was late, was not helped due to us arriving at a coaching gate and being bussed to the terminal. I then had just under 45 mins until my connection to SOF out of the D-gates. It seemed a long walk and despite a flight attendant telling me I did not need to re-clear security, this was required. This said I did manage to get to my gate before boarding started. Gate D33 was terribly small and over crowded and due to the level of background noise from people passing through security right next to the gate it was impossible to hear what the gate agent was saying over the PA system. Boarding commenced late and was unfortunately another bus to the aircraft. We departed a few minutes late and arrived 10-15 mins late in SOF to yet another bus arrival. So I can only conclude Austrian are trying to save money by turning down jet bridges at SOF when most gates with them were unoccupied at SOF T2. The inflight service was very similar to the flight from LHR, albeit slower to start and slower to get through the cabin. It was a choice of either a sweet pastry or breadstick little snacks. Complimentary beverages were served including alcohol however on this 1h15 flight there was only one drink offered. Overall conclusion on Austrian European short haul economy service is: polite, friendly; appreciate the complimentary beverages albeit the snacks are not a meal, but the amount of bussing to and from aircraft I experienced did not feel full service carrier. I would fly Austrian again at the right price point.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 777-200,Premium Economy,4.0,March 2018,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,Hong Kong to Zurich via Vienna,4.0," | I felt severely let down by Austrian Airlines. My first set of flights Hong Kong-Vienna-Zurich and return were ok: excellent cabin service but awful boarding procedures. A good initiative is being able to use the business lounge at Vienna for the payment of 30 euros, if one is a premium economy passenger. However, despite the boarding scrum (no area designated area for PE and business class passengers seemed not to fare much better) I still arrived quite happy and enjoyed the actual flight experience (good food, good wine good seats, and excellent service), so much so that I booked Austrian Airlines again out of Hong Kong for a second set of flights a month or so later. Austrian is one of very few airlines offering daylight flights in premium economy into Europe from Hong Kong. However, on the second planned flight disaster struck when I received an SMS in the middle of the night bluntly informing me that my flight from Hong Kong to Vienna was cancelled - that was it. Although I had carefully booked premium economy (partly due to some slight health problems) I found out that I had been shunted onto a midnight flight on Swiss International and downgraded to very basic economy. I was also shoved into a poor seat in the middle down the back on this long overnight flight. I was stunned. Why couldn't Austrian re-book me onto a similar Lufthansa premium economy flight (they are in the same Lufthansa group), albeit also an overnight flight? Why couldn't they otherwise offer a flight next day on Austrian Airlines which I worked out would have been suitable. I could see there were plenty of seats on these other flights in PE. Also beware that as Austrian Airlines is a typical small European airline its call centre and help desk are only open in their local daylight hours, Vienna time - almost useless if one is in Hong Kong or Tokyo trying to make contact. Also Austrian have a fairly small long-haul fleet, making it easily prone to disruption and cancellation for whatever reason. So Austrian (and Star Alliance) have lost a potential lucrative business traveller in me who was in the process of moving over from One World alliance for these flights. I make 15-20 long haul international flights per year, usually in premium economy or business and this experience with Austrian Airlines has sent me rushing back to Cathay Pacific and One World.",Business,2.0,nan

The flight was operated by Tyrolean Airways on behalf of Austrian Airlines with an Airbus A319. I was seated on the last row seat 24A. The leg room was decent and the new Recaro seats are ok but not more. The seats has no head-pillow so you must bring your own to sit comfortable and if you would like to take a nap. There was no food served on this 2 hours flight only a chocolate biscuit (the type that you buy on the gas station for 0.85 Euros or so).

The seat can be moved to 180 degree so to a horizontal position. The TV screen is a large TFT screen with a bright picture. Food was good too! Only problem for me is that they fly only 4 times/week.

What appeared to be a 3 stop return all on Austrian Airlines was actually across 3 airlines (Croatian Tyrolean and United) so when we tried to check in we were unable to do so online. We had a 1 hour layover in Vienna and the only reason we made our flight is because Austrian was so disorganized they were delayed in boarding the flight from Vienna to Chicago. Our boarding passes we received in Croatia didn't work in Vienna. When I tried to board the attendant dismissed the boarding pass and said it was no good. I had to check in again. My friend had the same issue so we went to the gate and they reprinted the exact same pass. In addition it is very irresponsible for the airline to book a one hour layover when it would easily take 2 hours at least to get from one gate to the other especially with Vienna requiring customs to get in and out of the airport and you have to go through security again. I give credit to the personnel who kept reprinting our tickets at each stop.

The crews on both flights were fantastic and they do really know how to provide excellent and personalised service. You will get your blanket and pillow covered with linen duvet covers (in C-Class). Connection in VIE is most convenient of all airports in Europe which I know. Good value for money considering that OS is a European company which does not work in a tax and social security free environment with huge governmental support like the Gulf carriers. Austrian offers one of the best long haul products in C-Class in the world. Short haul flights are equally good. Strongly recommended!,nan,5.0,nan

Short connection times at VIE make this a fast route. Worst experience is the seating on OS25. Premium Miles & More customers are usually reserved seats in rows 1 and 3. This works fine except when the airline uses row 2 for families with small children or upgrades. Sleep was made difficult on OS25 by shouting at their children to control them and shouting at each other audible across 2 aisles.

I have generally received a pass when arriving into BKK on Swiss but not recently on LH. Shoddy service to premium passengers and I suspect yet another example of cost cutting.

Asked at my seat and was told there are bottles at every seat. None at any seat because they had forgotten to put them out. They served a drink snack packet but they did not have a drinks service. Then came the food with a drinks service. Very strange for Business Class. The crew were miserable false cold smiles and they were clearly Tyrolean Charter Crew and not used to dealing with scheduled passengers on a route like Vienna to Dubai in Business Class. The Business Class seat was lie flat but the whole surround was very plastic and cheap. The table needed Einstein's brain to open and close it back into the seat. Finally our baggage did not arrive at Dubai so clearly the 09.05 ex London flight connection will always miss baggage transfer to the Dubai service. We arrived 24th December and our baggage arrived Christmas Day at 16.00 hours.

Fortunately ground staff in VIE were more helpful particularly during boarding with small children.

Return is where the problems start - at Male they can only check you in for the MLE-VIE sector - at VIE we found the flight overbooked for LHR with options for the next morning as they had let our seats go. Abysmal service when you have been flying for 9 hours and apparently this is not a concern of Austrian Airlines that there agents can't check you through from Male. We were not alone in having problems with OS connections on a Friday afternoon so be warned fly this route at your peril. After kicking off they eventually found our seats again but then due to technical problems delayed the flight by over an hour with what can only be described as limited explanation - the usual chaos at LHR (not OS's fault on this to be fair) added a further 40 minutes to the delay - a great holiday but not a nice surprise from Austrian at the end.,nan,4.0,nan

After years of flying American carriers, we didn't expect any help from the crew (like you get with the Sky Nanny service on Gulf Air or the friendly cabin crew on Emirates/Singapore Airlines). On Austrian, the cabin crew came around multiple times and politely asks us to shut our baby up as it ""may"" bother other passengers. No further comment needed. The food was ok, and the TV screens were hi-def, and the cabin crew were efficient, but the above incidents left a bad after-taste. We had subsequent connections with Lufthansa, and immediately saw the difference in crew training - Lufthansa crew are top notch and knew exactly what to do with little kids unlike the untrained Austrian crew.

Austrian rebooked me (and about 100 other stranded passengers) to the next flight without problems (and even got me a seat with extra legroom) not minding that the ticket was not flexible. They also provided food and drinks for the passengers regardless that the train breakdown wasn't their responsibility. Apart from that the service was good with a full meal service on the 3-hour leg however no entertainment (ok for three hours but you have to be aware of it).,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Business Class,5.0,nan,5.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,5.0,So having written a critical review of a trip to Male from London Heathrow in September 2014 I now have to be fair and balanced. Was nervous when best business class fares by far LHR-BKK came out on OS particularly with an exceptionally tight connection of just 30 minutes in VIE. Usual chronic Heathrow delays meant serious chance of missing connection but OS pulled stops out met us and guided us to the gate - shortest transfer I've ever done on the ground for just 15 minutes. Business class service absolutely faultless on both sectors with some seriously outstanding crews - return flights equally efficient. Well done Austrian you have restored my faith and will now be more comfortable flying you again.,nan,5.0,nan

The quality of the cabin and of the IFE has extremely improved. The seats were the modern thinner ones but were comfortable and I could even sleep. The IFE is new with touch-screen and the content is quite rich with films available in several languages. As we travelled during night (departure 2.30 am) we were served immediately a snack and then a breakfast before landing. The food was nothing special and even a bit cold too: we can say that it was the only bad point. The crew was professional maybe not too smiling but that was not important as we all wanted to rest. In general I can say that I was much more satisfied compared to my previous experience in 2013. Transit through VIE smooth as usual. Flight to MXP on an A320 totally uneventful with a correct standard of service for a European flight. As FTL I could enter the lounge in VIE: quite nice but a bit overcrowded as it was early morning.,nan,4.0,nan

The flight crew were excellent throughout our journey catering to all needs and exceeding expectations. The entertainment screen was wonderful with a vast selection.

VIE-AMS in Business (Upgrade due to Star Alliance status as Economy was overbooked) AMS- VIE in Economy VIE-AMS delayed 15 minutes due to ATC return flight on time – Not really much to distinguish Business Class service on the outward leg except for a simple and small but tasty evening snack (warm chicken skewer on salad). Also only one drink was served. Seats were rather uncomfortable economy Recaro slim seats with the middle seat left unsold. Service was very poor. Only two flight attendants for the whole full plane meant that after the initial service of meal and drink both FA's dealt with Economy and were not be seen in Business again for a very long time. On the return flight in Economy one drink (including beer and wine) and a no food just small pack of pretzels or a small chocolate bar was served. On both flights FA's were not exactly unpleasant but not attentive. Web check-in for VIE-AMS went smooth with almost no line for the premium bag drop. In AMS check-in for the return flight was handled by very friendly and helpful LH agents with no lines. Boarding in VIE was later than indicated with no information given resulting in a cattle call once the boarding actually started. Boarding in AMS was uneventful. Flagship OS Senator Lounge in VIE a bit of disappointment as well. Packed and with limited food offerings and just ok drink options. Obviously savings all over the place. In AMS OS uses the shared Servisair lounge which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a very limited to almost non-existent food selection. Overall definitely not a terrible but distinctly mediocre experience. (Star Alliance Gold).,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,2.0,Operated by Tyrolean Airways. LHR-BKK via VIE on 22 Dec 2014 in Economy. A ticket from LHR-BKK via VIE on Austrian. Our return leg - thankfully - was with Swiss from SIN-LHR via ZRH. Firstly they messed up our seat numbers that were reserved online/via phone. Even the nice lady at LHR check-in couldn't change the seating for the long-haul and we were advised to check with staff in VIE. Upon arrival in VIE after a forgettable experience (makes me wonder why they bother operating as a full-service airline when I am finding other LCCs to provide a better experience) there was madness at the gate as the flight was full of families and other fellow holidayers who were heading to Thailand. Spoke with ground staff who gave a curt reply about the flight being full and it is not possible to amend the seats - even if it was an error on their part. All passengers were then herded like animals via a self-service boarding gate while about 7 ground crew members stared blankly at passengers. When we stepped into the plane the atmosphere from the flight attendants were intense. Even the 'Good Evening' greeting seemed forced. I then approached one of the more senior female attendants about the wrongly allocated seats. She replied very rudely that they have no control over seats and I would have to ask other fellow passengers. I have never experienced such an insulting manner on board any airline ever. In any case we managed to swap seats with a very kind lady who was travelling alone. I felt so sorry that she had to take my ill-assigned seat which had almost no recline. The Seafood and Vegetarian Meals my travelling companion and I requested was also not prepared for us on board. They demanded proof that we had made the order in advance. But thankfully there was the Vegetarian Option served as part of the normal service. The seats were also uncomfortable and hard while the entertainment system was very limited. Could hardly find anything satisfying to watch. Upon leaving the aircraft I was given a cold hard stare from the same rude senior female flight attendant (I think she was the purser) at the exit with no apology smile or even a goodbye. Overall I am not only disappointed with my flight I am angry for the way we have been treated by Austrian. My advice is not to take this airline - particularly for long haul in economy - even if it is somewhat cheap!,nan,3.0,nan

On board this was an excellent experience not the most modern plane but updated with the new business class and a very fresh look excellent 1-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats Business just half full. IFE was AVOD with large high quality screens movie selection was fine with some out of the box choices but after one flight I have watched what I wanted to see. FA's were professional attentive and friendly. Meals served were tasty and with Austrian and international choices and of restaurant quality. Lunch was a choice of various Antipasti from a carte soup a choice of 3 mains (very good prawn curry or Viennese veal goulash or pumpkin/ham pasta) and a choice of hot/cold desserts. The second meal was a choice of Salmon with potato cakes or Chicken Quesadillas. Wines served were predominantly from Austria. However drinks in general were just ok. Some drink runs between the meals additional drinks available in the galley. Non-Schengen OS flagship lounge in Vienna rather compact with an ok breakfast selection. However no coffee tea etc. as both machines were out of order. Check-in friendly and competent but boarding was a mess. Additional document control with security questions for US flights right before boarding was carried out by just one (1) employee for the whole plane leading to one very long not really recognizable - line. However there were four gate agents afterwards with nothing to do due the bottleneck at the document control. Due to the weird design of the new terminal it was then not even possible to reach the end of the line when the boarding process actually started in earnest. After a cattle call for boarding with no premium boarding whatsoever passengers from all directions literally stormed the check point and people who have been standing in line were kept waiting while employees directed other people to go first to simply get them out of the way probably one of the most incompetent boarding procedures I have seen so far. While the terminal design in VIE is no fault of OS the choice of the procedure used is OS's choice. Immigration in ORD was a breeze however priority bags were out whenever. So after some mediocre flights with OS within Europe this was an excellent experience in air but not so good on the ground. Still highly recommended for the quality of the long-haul in- flight services. (Star Alliance Gold).,nan,5.0,nan

My flight was paid for by the company I work for and I flew Economy class and it was the exact same story as before - unfriendly cabin crew horrible in-flight catering and relatively uncomfortable (hard) seats. Both my flights were operated by an A320 aircraft which to my surprise was relatively clean. However my first flight from Vienna to Bucharest OS 783 got cancelled apparently due to low demand. I was re-routed to Bucharest on the next day on OS 791 which was alright although I missed an event I was supposed to attend in Bucharest. The flight back was uneventful and was about 35% full (I even had one entire row to myself. On this leg there was an on-time takeoff and landing back in Vienna. The food consisted of a choice between an Apple or a small bag of solettis. I heard some flight attendants refuse to give passengers either two soletti bags or two apples - Each passenger is only allowed one which is simply unacceptable. There is however a decent variety of drinks as well as decent in-flight entertainment. I honestly could not feel more sorry for myself having to fly Austrian for each one of my business trips. If it'd be my choice I'd choose Tarom for the VIE-OTP route without hesitation or simply any other airline other than Austrian.,nan,nan,nan

I see Austrian Airlines is taking its cue from the lacklustre North American airlines. Another problem was the long queues during check-in: Austrian Airlines' self- check in machines were not working meaning passengers could not print their boarding passes or complete their check-in leading to long queues at the check in desks.

The lounge in C is better but still tricky. The plane was a dated 777 with odd colors. Staff on the first trip was ok but my second time around they were extremely nice and attentive.

Food service - a dry bread with the thinnest slice of cheese and ham which they promote as the best catering by DO&CO. Poorest quality and no recommencing for DO&CO.

My preferred seat is the A seat in the last row. So naturally I choose this one when checking in. So it was my fault that I was sitting right next to the engine. The noise was incredible. I plugged my headphones in to die down the noise a little. Service was mediocre. Nothing special - regional airline standard I guess. The connection in Vienna was strange since we had to pass security again though we had been cleaned in Munich. The waiting area for regional flights in Vienna is old and shabby. Not much to do. At least they had free internet - but it disconnected every 10 minutes or so. Wasn't too fond of that experience but bet that the medium and long haul product is a lot better.,nan,3.0,nan

I took an old B777 from Vienna to Narita Tokyo and experienced one of my best long haul trips. Boarding was smooth and swift departure was on time. Cabin is colorful and not very trendy but the retro feeling inside is loveable. It was clean and neat. Unparalleled service started right after taking off. Do&Co Vienna restaurateurs' on board chef convert the cabin into an ultra-class restaurant above the clouds. Best cuisine I have ever had on an airplane. Cabin attendants did their best to make passengers feel great throughout the flight. Those criticized angled flat sleeper seats are not that bad not worse that of Lufthansa.

I would certainly fly Austrian again as the planes were relatively new clean and comfortable. The only thing that I could not do as I have done with other airlines I have flown is try and pick my seat when booking the flight it may just be because the flight came up on the Lufthansa booking site but never mind all in all I was pretty happy with it all.,nan,4.0,nan

However nothing can make up for the worst seat I have ever sat on. When boarding you are bombarded by 70's green carpet pale blue bulkheads and purple seats with wood grain shells and yellow pillows! That could be excused if the seat made up for it but it is impossible to get comfortable in any position as it feels like being on a hard lumpy narrow bench. I used 2 blankets to try and soften the seat / angled bed but forget sleeping. The cabin was too warm which only added to the discomfort.

The interior is very dated indeed: very narrow and worn-out seat no flat bed poor IFE odd colours. Austrian flights always bussed to the airplane at DXB. Positive are the FAs and the quality of the catering and the cheaper fees which do reflect the quality of the product. Austrian is not 4 stars long-haul.

Of course I don't expect a full lie flat bed but they should be having a good look at the new Turkish short haul business class seat which is fit for purpose.

Outward plane a Boeing 737 and return an Airbus 320. The planes looked clean and well maintained. What lets the service down is attention to details and quality of human interactions. The drop down screens show a very old moving map and the safety cartoon. On the return flight the screen was just left down but blank for 40 minutes before some old cartoons were shown. The cabin crew appear to do what is required of them but with no great zeal. Passengers offered a drink and a muffin on outward flight. On the return leg a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes. The new terminal in Vienna had a similar problem although not quite so bad but still a lengthy walk to passport control and I found very badly signposted.

Dinner started with canapés but drinks served afterwards the starter and soup were good and my beef was served medium rare which was excellent and the accompanying red wine very palatable. Cheese and dessert accompanied by a dessert wine and a Baileys coffee from the Coffee menu rounded off a decent meal. The cabin was too hot so I slept fitfully!

The 40 minutes transfer time in VIE was a hassle we had to go through security checks again on a within Europe/Schengen flight so that caused some stress although all the passengers on the flight to Düsseldorf we're transferring passengers.,nan,4.0,nan

Inbound in Economy - same seats as in Business. Very limited catering on this two-hour flight: quite small ham sandwich drinks.

What really bothered me was the terminal in Vienna. Its quite a hurry to change planes as you have to go through security again.

Food was good nice portions but not that much greater than regular C class food. It was nice to get warm bread buns however. Nice wines and in general nice service. DME-VIE the Austrian lounge in DME is nice not crowded at all and with nice views. Priority boarding access directly from the lounge to the gangway very nice! Flight was operated by a professional crew who did everything they could to make us feel comfortable. Jackets were taken like on long-haul C class trips. Food good and wine once again nice.

In front of us was a family with 3 kids and the father reclined the seats back during take off. He was not willing to set them into the upright position even during dinner.

Again nobody in the departure hall to assist passengers. Announcements were either inappropriate or late. Two staff members tried to identify passengers from their flight to give them a 5 EUR voucher however again they did not care about Star Alliance Gold status at all.

The 3x3 configuration with the middle set blocked was not the most comfortable but business was quite empty and it was a short (1 hr 10 mins) flight so cannot complain. Enjoyed the light blue with red leather seats decor of the cabin a nice departure from the frequent dark blues and greys from other airlines. Flight attendant welcoming and professional spoke good English and worked hard to make flight enjoyable. Around 11am a full lunch was served with starter hot breads small salad with black forest cake for dessert. A nice Austrian sparkling wine and hot coffee with pralines to close. Wien airport looked new and huge cannot understand why we parked on a remote area and they had to stuff all the passengers on one bus many fingers where available. From Wien to Frankfurt another spotless plane this time an A-321 with the Euro standard business with 3x3 and blocked middle seat. It was a bit more comfortable than the 737-800 and this time cabin was almost full. During the sunset the friendly FA served a full dinner with starter small salad nice pork schnitzel with potato salad a very good chocolate-mousse tart and coffee and pralines.

I didn't see them doing any rounds of drinks in between meals. VIE-KIV flight was on a Fokker 70. Good seat comfort and good flight overall although nothing spectacular. The service on this leg consists of a chocolate waffle. Connecting in Vienna's new terminal was a nice experience and so was the Business lounge.

Food was excellent (as usual) steward addressed guests by name lots of refills excellent. Downs: IFE (but not really needed for the 2hr flight) reduction in flights the afternoon flight is stopped this season which is strange since the flight was quite full (A320 instead of the scheduled A319) and this allows a normal arrival time in Vienna (7pm) instead of 11pm with the evening flight. The £40 difference from Economy to Business was worth it because of an extra piece of luggage lounge good food and attentive service. Can recommend flying Austrian.,nan,4.0,nan

On one journey I ordered from the à la carte menu in advance and this was excellent value for money - really good quality.

Captain kept the passengers informed on connecting flights. During the waiting time the crew offered free drinks and newspapers. I asked for a special Austrian paper and received it with a smile. In the air we were served tea or coffee and a small snack. Return flight was also pretty good same experience except for the delay as we landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

My only quibble is that the Captain takes an awful long time to switch off the seatbelt sign so long on the return flight (after 30 mins climbing and in calm air) that the senior crew member had to go into the cockpit to check whereupon the seat belt sign was switched off immediately and service began. Excellent food and drinks as usual by Austrian. One complaint: on return flight to LHR cabin lights did not get switched on after take off on questioning this was told that there were approx 100 Japanese pax who'd transferred from a day flight from Japan and requested a dark flight. Cabin crew member for business pax rightly asked if I wanted lights switched on I said no but did think that on a short 2hr flight to London not acceptable for a group to dictate the lighting on a plane - but sympathise with Austrian if this is a regular and lucrative booking!

Crew polite and efficient but a bit cold (and with terrible uniforms). The only inconvenience was in Vienna airport: in order to catch the connection we had to run because we lost time at an unnecessary additional security control as we proceeded from another EU member State although out of Schengen area.

Food in both cases quite good but unlike previous occasions no choices regarding options you take what is offered or nothing. The inbound trip saw the meals distributed and it taking around 20 minutes before drinks appeared which meant either eating without drinks or letting the hot snack go cold. Finally there was a 45 minute delay in delivering the baggage at LHR apparently due to an aircraft technical failure.

We had to reschedule our flights and cancelled our accommodation in Dubrovnik, and also missed out on a start of a cruise that we were to catch up with on Korcula. We had made arrangements to catch the last ferry that evening that would take us from Dubrovnik to Korcula. Halfway to Dubrovnik our flight was rerouted to Zagreb which led us to miss our ferry. This left us stranded in a strange city at peak season on a Sunday evening with no chance for accommodation. We notified our cabin crew that we had missed our connection and they directed us to the land crew who were to help us make further arrangements. At the airport terminal, we quickly realised that there was no Austrian Airlines representative available. We asked the information where a lady pointed to the Croatian Airlines counter who represent Austrian Airlines in Croatia. When turning to the Croatian Airlines counter, the lady shrug her shoulders and asked us to ""write an email to Austrian"". She did offer to look up whether there were any other ferries or buses to Korcula but there were none until the next morning. Then I asked: ""Who could help us?"" I was given the worst possible answer a customer service officer could give: ""You can only help yourselves."" Finally, after a very expensive taxi ride to Orebic and catching the last passenger ferry we made it to Korcula. No thanks to Austrian Airlines. The following day me and my partner lodged a feedback form and a request for an official statement to confirm that our flight was delayed so we could claim the extra expenses from our insurance. After a month of no response from their customer service and after exchanging email with them over two months, we are yet to receive our statements. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

Flying from JFK via Vienna to Budapest return, I found out that in order to book seat reservations one must pay extra or to do so within 36 hours of the flight's departure. Going online, this proved impossible, even less than 36 hours before departure as it stated ""You cannot reserve a seat on this flight"" so a call to Austrian Airlines in the USA within 36 hours of departure indicated that they could not or would not book a seat. One had to arrive at the airport and take one's chances. The Boeing 777 Austrian flies from JFK has the most cramped seats regarding width of seat and pitch and this was further complicated by a very corpulent seatmate who kept his legs far apart and spilled over into my seat snatching about one third of my allocated space. The meals served on Austrian in Economy have been downgraded in quality and quantity - chicken or pasta. The chicken dish served enroute to Vienna was rather tasteless. Lufthansa and Swiss have metal cutlery - why cannot Austrian? I tried to opt for a Do&Co meal online for the flight from JFK to Vienna (at extra charge) some weeks before departure, but Austrian's website rejected that request. Austrian's once glorious breakfast in economy (cold cut plate, fruit etc) has been downgraded to a warm cheese pannini served in a napkin. The same type pannini was served as the second meal returning to NYC. The main meal out of Vienna to JFK was tastier than the flight originating at JFK but it was quite small. In Budapest it also proved impossible to book a reserved seat online within 36 hours for the return flight. Austrian has a larger IFE screen than Lufthansa or Swissair, with a large dose of classical music on offer and a slightly simpler ability to operate the visual entertainment. Service onboard is average or slightly above. Austrian was once among the finest of airlines to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the USA - now it is more of a budget airline. The short flight Vienna to Budapest on a propeller plane had no service save for a bottle of water -  but a very short 45 mins flight.

Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesn’t have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, it’s very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering I’ve ever had.

We only found out about our flight being delayed via the board at the gate; there were no ground staff to inform passengers of this and when I trapsed down the other end of the terminal to the only counter that had any staff, the Austrian airlines representative was so rude.  When the plane finally took off, the entertainment system had limited choice and the headphones were so bad, that even with the volume full it was drowned out by the engine. So films were watched with subtitles and no sound, which is annoying on a long haul flight. Again, the food was delicious on this flight and the selection of drinks/beverages was good. When it came to our flight home from Delhi, we arrived at the airport, giving all our documents to the guard who checks it before letting you proceed into the airport. He informed us that our flight didn’t exist anymore and we would need to book another ticket. So off we went to the help desk to which we were informed that Austrian had stopped their service from DEL to VIE and we’d been moved to a Lufthansa flight. This was fine, but we had not been informed and meant that we had arrived at the airport 6 hours early for our flight, which was now scheduled to depart at 2:45am. I queried about the a la carte food that I had paid £34 for and the staff said that was fine, but we received no special food, and Austrian have not refunded this to my card.

While queuing, I had ample opportunity to watch the demotivated, unfriendly and seemingly overstrained staff. Their supervisor made occasional appearances, discussing how to organise the shift and which employee could leave when, not casting a single look at the queue of meanwhile 20 impatient passengers. After more than half an hour, I was granted the privilege of acquiring the Upgrade for the amount of €225. I did not use the OS lounge - I was too fascinated to see the overcrowded airport and Austrian announcing one delay after the other. 'Due to he late arrival of the incoming aircraft'. Strangely, it was all Austrian planes that had left Vienna 2–3 hours before. On board, the added value of Business consisted of an empty seat besides me (as many were also in Economy), and an open curtain providing panoramic views of the cabin. The meal consisted of coleslaw, to mini meatballs and a stale jellyroll (see photo). An effrontery to charge €225 what at best did cost Austrian an incremental €10.

We appreciate the generosity of Austrian Airlines and the customer respect we received from this Airline. It appears that delay in flights is not unusual with Austrian Airlines.

While I do have to say that the ground personnel attitude with us was a plus (maybe because of my Gold status?), the lack of information and impact on my work are unacceptable. What I find even more impressive was the sheer amount of people, from many destinations, that were at the service counter complaining or obtaining vouchers for restaurants and hotels.

It took them an hour to sort this all out. I agree the airline managed to beat even Aeroflot on the price but that does not justify their lack of common sence.

The overhead bins were full so the flight attendants asked us to place smaller items under the seat or to check the bags in the baggage hold free of charge. The seats were okay for short-medium flight durations. However, I did not appreciate the fact that we were offered only a small salty or sweet snack and a drink for the 2hr journey.

The cabin crew were generally unsmiling and disinterested, although they did work hard to get the first meal served quickly so passengers could sleep. Leg room is on the narrow side, although the seat itself is comfortable. IFE was okay. The food was a let down. Portions were small and the fish, which is usually a healthy option, was just deep fried portions with rice and a small amount of sauce. There was just a sandwich for breakfast, which seems ungenerous on an 11+ hour flight. On the upside we also flew the 777 to TLV and the service on that flight was excellent.

I flew from LYS to PVG with SWISS and from PVG to LYS with Austrian Airlines, so I had the possiblity to make the direct comparison between these two Star Alliance members. The flight took about 11.5 hours. During this time the crew served us bewerage just before and during the two meals. If you expect they would come around from time to time to ask the passengers if they'd like to have a glass of water - you were wrong. After some hours I had to go by myself on the back of the plane to ask them for some drinks and a little snack (since the meal itself wasn't even that big, not even for an economy class meal). Besides the fact that the flight attendant didn't even care about us and not even bothered to smile, two of four toilets were not working. After mealtime many people had of course the need to go to the restroom - with a waiting time of sometimes over 15 mins. I guess that's why they didn't serve as much drink as they maybe usually do? What disturbed me most is that the crew or the maitre the cabine didn't greet the passengers at the beginning of the flight or informed us about the failure of the toilets. Just the captain mentioned it 1 hour before landing, and thanked us for our understanding. The overall experience of Austrian is cheap service with lousy flight attendants and bad maintenanced aircrafts.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Check in was a little bit slow and also they don't keep the Business Class check in counter only for business class, they also let economy class passengers. However, security check was fast. I went to the Vitosha Lounge, which very nice. There is priority boarding at Sofia - they let you skip the line and be one of the first to go on the bus. I was the only one in the Business class cabin, which had 10 seats. The seating configuration onboard the E195 is 2-2 and in business class really is 1-1, because they keep one of the seats blocked.

At the gate, agent refused to honor printed boarding pass that indicated my 1k premier status and wanted to see physical evidence. Fortunately UA app has my card in its file and was able to convince agent to let us through.

Flight attendant as we were approaching Vienna kindly moved us with our hand luggage to Business Class so we could be among first to exit plane. As we were not familiar with airport it took us sometime to locate gate for our onward flight and owing to age, health and mobility issues we were not in the best state when we got there. We were also unaware that we would have to go through another security check and this is where our experience was unacceptable. The lack of dignity afforded to my wife when she set off the security alarm was unnecessary and caused a great deal of stress. Not only were we late and concerned we would not make our onward flight but there was no female attendant available to carry out the search. The male employee was rude. The female employee, when she turned up, was no better. Accept that the flight was delayed, this happens, but it would have been good to have been told that the Sarajevo flight was also delayed, which would have given us sufficient time to make our onward flight.

Originally, a smaller Boeing 767 was scheduled, that was also one of the reason we booked this flight. But unfortunately the flight was rescheduled to a triple-seven, with 3-4-3 abreast seating, which is hated by the passengers. So we pre-booked our seats in advance (for a surcharge), to get one of the few seats in the rear of the cabin where the fuselage is narrowing and only 2 instead of 3 seats in the window-rows are used. Definitely worth the 50€ we paid! The flight left with a small delay, but landed on time. Lufthansa's JFK ground staff were not polite, fast or effective. But the cabin crew were OK. The seating on narrow seats was fine for a 8 hour flight, but I can't imagine myself being squeezed there for a few more hours. The cabin crew were fine, but keeping a distance from the passengers and being not as nice as those on the previous Lufthansa flight. The food was mediocre and portions very small - we had booked a vegetarian meal, and for the breakfast, it meant only a few pieces of fresh fruit, whereas other passengers had a giant cereal muffin. Apart from the obvious cost-savings by not using a tray and only handing out one piece of food, the fruit box was very small and definitely not enough for breakfast. Thankfully, one of the cabin attendants gave us spare muffins too, upon our request. Thanks for that!

The onboard service may be nothing too special, but you'll still get a warm snack and complimentary drinks. For two hour flights that's sufficient. As we were travelling as a family we also got crayons, coloring books and some playing cards for our daughter. The crew was very attentive and proactive. When our daughter feel asleep they brought a pillow without being asked. On the way to Zakynthos the flight departed and arrived on time.

Check-in was relatively slow, but the lady there gave us a warm greeting and sent our checked bags away quickly. The flight was fully booked, so there were plenty of people in line. The gate felt extremely small, especially on a fully booked flight. Austrian fortunately was good at crowd control, so people got to their respective seats quickly. The seat was clean and very comfortable, and had all the basic functions and necessities you would expect. Pillows and blankets were provided on this 11 hour and 40 minute flight, even though it was a day flight. The flight attendants, as always, were extremely kind and compassionate and always there when you needed them. Soon after takeoff, lunch was served. It was a mushroom pasta dish, which was pretty tasty. The IFE worked pretty well and was responsive, although it didn't have many movies or TV shows, unlike Lufthansa. Where Austrian makes up for this is in their prestigious service and delicious food. Snacks and drinks were served consistently throughout the flight. Near the end of our flight, a small meal of more pasta with olives and zucchini was served with some sort of pudding. It was phenomenal.

So I picked up my new boarding pass and settled into seat 10H which was the first row of Premium Economy. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 instead of 3-4-3 in Economy. Seat pitch was generous and incline was good giving me a good sleep for the 9.5 hour red eye flight. However, the earphones were of the in-ear type and sound quality was not good. I would have expected over-ear headphones for Premium Economy. No amenity kit was distributed but I guess this is standard practice for the majority of European airlines on their economy and premium economy products. Catering was of course economy catering.

Austrian's impeccably trained and very well-groomed cabin crew were at the top of their game both times. I also had a great experience with kind airport agents.  My first issue - seat selection for a booking made via United was not available on Austrian's website for the segments of my itinerary they operated. I was assigned random seats when I checked in. Lufthansa on the other hand  allow seat selection on their website for segments they operate, even when you book via United. My second issue was food. You'd expect that on a 9 hour overnight flight they'd pamper you more in terms of food (beverage service is pretty varied, but I care more about food service. On the long-haul flight for dinner they have a choice of two dishes with a limited amount of servings available, so that when one is gone, you are stuck with the other. The assumption that everyone will automatically accept what is left has proven wrong in my case, because for personal reasons, I didn't want the pasta with  that was left, but the dish that was gone (chicken). As they couldn't accommodate my request, I asked if they had any snacks for purchase. They first misunderstood me and gave me 3 more bags of some salty crackers that they had served as a starter.  I was told the only thing they had for purchase was chocolate (I assume as a part of their duty-free offer). It turned out my only option was to eat the dish that they had left, buy chocolate or stay hungry. Before landing we were served a muffin for breakfast.

My baby really active and I put tray with food on floor, so he doesn't mess with it and When time came to clean I asked the steward to clean it and he roll his eyes on me and said "" Are you serious put it on floor what I suppose to clean your mess after you now"".

A320,Economy Class,3.0,December 2016,3.0,4.0,nan,no,Vienna to Paris CDG,4.0," | Vienna - Paris CDG in Economy almost a year ago, transferring in CDG to an AF flight to the UK. Flight was booked with AF as a codeshare. Checked in at the manned premium OS counter (due to frequent flyer status), which was fast and friendly. Boarding – as almost in VIE with OS - slightly chaotic, but an average experience, as well as the flight itself. Solid, but not more. Drinks were free, however Austrian Airlines does not serve actual food in Y. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to a ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. While we made it to the new gate before departure time, the flight was already closed. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. No chance to make the connection. AF then rebooked us to flight leaving 6 hours later. Then we had to wait 1 hour (!) at the counter till AF got the approval from OS to issue a meal voucher for the delay, but OS could not care less to and needed to be called multiple time before they finally sent an approval. Simply ridiculous. Also, compensation for the delay under EU law was denied by OS citing extraordinary circumstances. How can a slightly later ATC slot be extraordinary circumstances? This is business as usual and flight statistics show that this is the usual delay for this morning flight. Even an intervention by the Austrian Customer Protection Agency did not help. OS denied their reasoning, as well. Will not recommend OS, as customer service and attitude handling the delay and compensation was terrible.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 767,Business Class,5.0,November 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Beijing to Vienna,5.0," |  Flew Beijing to Vienna. Check in at PEK airport smooth and fast. Once on the plane warmly welcomed by the purser by name. The plane took off one hour late because of chinese airtraffic control. Just waiting beside the runway for taking off but still managed an almost on time arrival at VIE airport. The food on Austrian business class is always a dream. I could choose between 8 different starters from the cart, an additional soup, 3 main dishes and 5 different kinds of dessert. The dessert is normally served like in a Vienna cafe with a choice of many different types of coffee. I took my favorite one, Vienna ice coffee. The flight attendants are always friendly and offered frequently drinks and snacks during the flight. Since Austrian modified the business class cabin a few years ago I prefer to travel Austrian business than LH first class. I am a star alliance gold member and if I want to travel on time with a good service than I know that I have to choose Austrian as my carrier.",Business,5.0,nan

In the same week, they managed to be late on three out of four flights of mine with them. When I had lost my connecting flight, because the first flight was delayed, the personnel at the airport were extremely rude and not really willing to help find a solution for my situation.

Checked in and was given the opportunity to upgrade on FLT 0087 to business class. There was a delay and after several hours the flight was cancelled. They would not refund my credit card for the upgrade even though they just charged it several house prior. Took many hours in the airport to be rescheduled for another flight. That flight was the next day(8/4) and I was booked on Air Berlin to Berlin and then Delta to NY JFK. Air Berlin took off late and I was refused boarding on Delta. The airport in Berlin had an Austrian Airlines and Air Berlin representation. After hours of waiting in lines both companies did nothing to help me at all. Found out Air Berlin was in bankruptcy. Both said they were not direct company employees and could not give compensation for being stuck again another day. Delta re booked for the next day (8/5). No one took responsibility. Finally arrived home in Florida on September 6, with a hurricane bearing down on the state. My luggage? Lost somewhere in Berlin. Finally received it on September 12.

nan,Business Class,2.0,January 2018,1.0,1.0,nan,no,Copenhagen to Vienna,2.0," | I booked economy flights from Copenhagen to Vienna for my husband and myself for 4 January 2018. As we were travelling in Europe during the winter for several weeks, we had more luggage than allowed under our ticket. The airline website encouraged purchasing extra luggage allowance online as it was cheaper than on arrival at the airport when checking in. I tried to do this several times but the website would not accommodate the request. A day or 2 before the flight, we were offered an upgrade to business class at a cost of €119 each, which we took up. The receipts for payment for the upgrades clearly showed an increased baggage allowance to 32kgs each which was more than sufficient for us. On arrival at the airport in Copenhagen for check in, the check in agent would not allow the increased luggage without further payment as it was her contention that the upgrade we paid for did not include increased luggage. At our request she called the airline twice but was told that we would have to pay extra DKK559. As we had no option, we paid the demanded amount. I lodged a complaint with the airline’s “guest service” team, attaching a copy of my receipt showing the increased baggage allowance as part of the business class upgrade. I also requested a refund of the DKK559 I had paid. I exchanged several emails with the “guest service” team before I was then informed that I would have to lodge my request anew with the airline’s feedback/complaints department via its website. I re-lodged my complaint/request as instructed and received an acknowledgement. I have received at least 2 further emails advising the airline “is committed to offering a high quality of service and your concern is therefore important to us. However, due to a high volume of requests, you may experience a delay in receiving a response”. My complaint/request was first lodged on 4 January, almost 4 months ago and I’m still waiting for a response to something that should be very straightforward. ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
A321,Economy Class,2.0,March 2018,2.0,3.0,nan,no,Munich to Vienna,3.0," | This was my first time flying Austrian Airlines on 2 small connecting flights: Munich-Vienna / Vienna-Iasi. I have to mention that I mostly fly low cost. I didn't expect any incredible inflight service because of the type of flight and destinations. Overall flight was good, snacks a bit small compared to most other ""normal"" airlines. However one thing felt exceptionally below service, especially for a Star Alliance airline. We were departing from MUC to VIE and I came to my seat amongst the last and the overhead was full. I was carrying 1 cabin trolley, plus my purse and laptop which I always put under my seat. With no place to put my cabin compliant trolley, I turned to the flight attendant for help, literally saying ""could you please help me stow my trolley, not sure where to put it"". She shrugged her shoulders in a very obvious ""and what do you want me to do?"" manner and said ""the overhead is full due to passengers bringing 2 pieces of large luggage"" and proceeded to not moving an inch, while looking at me. Then another passenger helped me make room in the overhead (probably his backpacks were there). I could have just pushed some random overhead bags really hard or asked some passengers to take out their smaller backpack and put it under their seat but really, I think this would have been rude on my side - I wouldn't want a stranger smushing my bags or asking me to move my stuff. I also strongly believe it is the flight attendant's job. It clearly *is* for all the low cost flights where flight attendants are taking really good care of this aspect. So I am expecting much more from a Star Alliance company that charges double or more of what a low cost would. At least I am expecting the willingness to be helped with basic things. If you can't be bothered to help me stow my luggage, I find that a problem, especially given the price I am paying. The rest of the flight attendands were great, accommodating, and we had some of the most talkative and informative captains on all of the Austrian flights - which I liked.",Business,2.0,nan

Both flights were on time, with the outbound one even arriving well before schedule. One the reasons for that might have been the surprisingly efficient boarding on both occasions. Check-in went smoothly at both airports, even though the counter was rather difficult to find in IAD, due to virtually non-existent information screens at that airport. Ground staff was always friendly. On both flights, cabin crew was very friendly and hard-working, running up and down to serve drinks throughout the whole flight. The food was very good and the onboard entertainment satisfactory. The plane was a seemingly modern B-767 with 2-3-2 seating and enough legroom, so that even as a tall man I was able to get some sleep.",Business,4.0,nan
Boeing 777,Economy Class,1.0,January 2018,1.0,4.0,3.0,no,Bangkok to Vienna,1.0," | I was very frustrated, not to say shocked with the apparently new Austrian service plan. First, Austrian puts 10 seats in one row of a 777 (3-4-3), while other airlines fly with 9 seats per row only. That by itself makes it hard to feel comfortable, since you are always in direct contact with the neighbour's shoulder. The worst however is the service. The food consisted of a 2 cm by 2 cm large piece of meat, a spoon of mashed potatoes and one carrot (see photo), served in a disposable triangle. Drinks were only offered once, following the new service plan of Austrian. When I complained about food and service one of the flight crew members told me that this is the new service directive and food service from Austria. The crew were not happy with it either and indeed felt embarrassed about the quality. All these little extras, that make a flight a little bit more comfortable are missing on Austrian. The nuts and drinks prior to the dinner, the hot (paper) towels prior to dinner and breakfast, nobody went through the cabin offering drinks. I emphasize, that I do not blame the crew. Indeed, they were all very friendly and helped as much as they could. But what can you do if there is not enough food/drinks on board and the company asks you to reduce the service to an absolute minimum. Well, I made my decision. Austrian long haul flights, never again. ",Family Leisure,2.0,nan

Switching from Oneworld to Star Alliance seems to have been a good idea since the quality of the product is way better. The planes I got to fly in were new and the seats very comfortable. At check-in, the operator at the business class desk, apologized for taking a person flying economy and that I had to wait for 2 minutes. I found that sweet. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive and it really makes a difference in the sky, even when flying just under 2 hours. Speaking of the flight attendants, their uniform was somehow strange, everything red, including shoes and stockings: unique indeed. I must say the food in business class was incredible and the selection of wines was everything I needed for my trip. Everything culminated with a cup of tea, served in Austrian's branded porcelain. Both flights were on time and connecting in Vienna, while not the quickest and not always stress free, made it possible for the whole trip OTP-VIE-TXL to be under 4h. The WiFi didn't seem to work. I connected myself with the network but I couldn't get the redirect page where to book the plans.

FlightCentre did get me alternate flight with other airlines but told me it should have been done by Austrian. And on the return flight from Vienna to Toronto the same issue, presumably with the same plane - the departure flight got delayed a couple of times, then it was cancelled after a delay of nearly 5 hours. I was not pleased and wowed to never fly Austrian again. Fortunately, this time they did much better, provided the customers with a airport hotel and food, and best of all - early next morning they got me to Paris and my final destination in Vancouver by another carrier (Air France). Because of this, I would give them another chance in the future and the professional and prompt resolution of the second cancellation improved my opinion of the airline a lot.

(Billund) - Copenhagen - Vienna - Hong Kong on A320 and B777-300, respectively. The short leg CPH-VIE seat had a terrible economy seat offering to business class passengers. Food was very sparse and only 1 hot dish was offered, completely in contrast to the international luxury offerings (see below). However, good FAs. Champagne offered. Check-in in BLL (Denmark) with a useless, inert, junior agent (3rd party, SAS-agent) could not identify my onwards bookings (despite providing boarding cards as prof) and rejected to check-in my luggage further than HKG. The long haul flight VIE-HKG was one of my best flights ever. Have been missing Austrian for its innovations, fresh and super-alert FA’s, colours, decos, and excellent food. 3 Austrian beers offered, one in original bottles. 2 champagnes, lots of reds and whites. For Lunch I consumed two main-dishes: the calf was devine. Also, an Italian cheese-pasta was very nice. 3 hot meals offered on this 12 hours flight: they had each 3, 1, and 2 hot offerings, respectively (for lunch, supper, and breakfast). The VIE-HKG was full but the FA coped well: smiling, attentive, focused, proactive, and caring. The flight was 10/10 but the seat could not recline to horizontal position (lacking 3-5 degrees). The handset controller did not work. Further, the flight CPH-VIE on a A320 cannot exceed an 8/10 score. Altogether, an exotic, focused airline of high quality. Luggage arrived smoothly.

Upon reaching the plane I asked if I could please keep my suitcase because I had a lot of personal belongings in it and I have back problems.

The business class cabin crew's attitude and poor performance in service have been the key problem. After boarding, there was no help with luggage or seating to anybody. Once some crew members realized that we do not speak German, they lost any interest to communicate with us at all. With the exception of personal welcome from the main purser and only one flight attendant, the rest of the crew did not care for a majority of this long-haul daytime flight. After the take-off, the breakfast has been served. Then, the crew gave up almost to be presented for the passengers, or at least to ensure to refill in some frequency any kind of drinks at the “minibar” in the galley. When someone from the crew has “checked” the cabin, it was the high speed run through the aisle. I was lucky to call the flight attended and asked her for a drink, as there had been nothing in the galley minibar at that time. No answer, but the face told enough, that I had exceeded some unwritten limit perhaps. Absolutely unbelievable. The more offended face, when she came back with the drink. The lunch, served about 3 hours prior the landing, was delicious. With the mentioned exception of that one professional flight attendant, nobody has cared about the passengers (no refilled drinks again, no talks, no motivation to look professional at least).
