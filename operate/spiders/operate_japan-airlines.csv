Boeing 787-9,Premium Economy,5.0,July 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Sydney to Tokyo,5.0," |  This was my first time traveling with Japan Airlines and  I could not have been more happier. I made sure to arrive early to check in as me & my partner could not find any seats together. Upon talking to the check in staff they were able to give us a free upgrade to premium economy in order to compensate not being able to have me and my partner seated together on our booked economy fare. I was so shocked by the kindness and sincere empathy the check in staff had in regards to my situation. It was definitely an amazing start to the trip. Apart from being upgraded, JAL's amazing service continued to shine through its efficient ground staff, seat product and service on board. My first encounter with Japanese efficiency transpired with JAL's extremely fast and efficient boarding process. I was one of the first to board and it felt like 5 minutes after I sat down we were already on pushback, boarding literally took about 10 minutes which was amazing for a full flight. Boarding being done quickly meant we had a prompt ahead of schedule departure which was fantastic knowing how busy Sydney Airport can get traffic wise during the morning rush. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Also, the cabin seemed extremely clean. The toilets were clean and hygienic. During meal service, staff were generous with the food & beverage offerings. Food is never an aspect of air travel I like, however, Japan Airlines offers a range of food options throughout the flight and you can pick up or ask for fresh food like instant noodles, chips, biscuits and chocolate. I couldn’t stomach the lunch service, however the instant noodles were a life saver. There was also regular hot towels distributed through the flight which made it a nice touch. One interesting observation I made was the lack of odour in the cabin. You know that strong aroma you get during the food service in which kind of makes you want to gag (well... at least for me)? Or when the cabin crew usually run drinks service and the whole cabin gets infused with the horrible bitterness of bad coffee? Well there was none of that here, It was very pleasant. I found JAL's IFE to be one of the most responsive I have experienced. The flight map is so interactive and explorable. You can zoom in and out of the map and get detailed views of your flight path. The entertainment selection was also excellent and there are movies in over 20 languages! Being onboard the Boeing 787 also meant the windows are big and the electronic tint provides a calming ambiance to the cabin. This is matched with the soft warm white lighting which was turned on after lunch so people could relax. And later on the flight when the lights were turned off a gentle purple illuminated the ceiling.  Overall, Japan Airlines proved to be one of the best carriers I have ever chosen to fly with. From the moment of check in to disembarkation, Japan Airlines truly lived up to my expectations of being a 5 star Skytrax airline.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
Boeing 787-900,Economy Class,4.0,July 2018,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes,Tokyo Narita to Kuala Lumpur ,4.0," | Flew Tokyo Narita to Kuala Lumpur. Check in line at Narita was not as efficient as expected of JAL and the queue was very long. Spent almost an hour in the line and the ground staff were not too friendly. Things changed on board as the service was impeccable as usual and the seats, in-flight entertainment, and meals were perfect.",Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0
Boeing 787,Business Class,5.0,May 2018,5.0,4.0,1.0,yes,Tokyo to Melbourne,4.0," | First time with Japan Airlines. The flight to Tokyo was late at night, so not much to report. The return flight was during the day and was mostly excellent. Highlights are the excellent service and the food. Just wonderful. Unfortunately, there are lows and they related to hardware and software. The seat is comfortable, however my window seat had almost no storage space except for among the magazines next to the screen (see pic). The IFE is truly sub-standard. Very few movies, the music select was small and in each category there were only a few tracks. Painful to operate as well. This is nickle and dime stuff in a premium product and a pity as the service is so very good.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,June 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City,5.0," | Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City. This is probably the best flight crew I have ever had. I lost a bag with souvenirs for my parents inside which is totally my responsibilty for losing it. I informed the police at the airport and he guided me to the information counter to the JAL staff. They were calling and running to get my lost package. This is amazing, never thought I could claim my baggage again. Through this I want to thank the police officer that helps me and staff from JL079.",Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0
Boeing 787-8,Business Class,3.0,March 2018,4.0,3.0,3.0,yes,Tokyo Narita to San Diego,2.0," |  Tokyo to San Diego. I have had four Japan Airlines flights in the past 30 days, all the flights were in business class. There is a huge difference between the business class offerings of these flights. The 787 is a great aircraft.  US Immigration in San Diego is quick and efficient. JL65/66 very poor and uncomfortable business class seats. I am very surprised that JAL would use old seats in a new aircraft. The pillow is tiny and inadequate. Service is not up to the normal JAL levels. Narita immigration is very slow. Positives for flights #01 & #02. - Super seat layout. - Very comfortable seats. Super attentive service. Haneda immigration is super fast.",Business,3.0,3.0
Boeing 777-200,Business Class,5.0,April 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,Singapore to Tokyo Haneda,4.0," |  Singapore to Tokyo Haneda. This is one airline I would definitely fly again if heading towards Japan or onwards to USA. It represents great value for money when compared to other premium Asian carriers who  charge 40-50% more for the same product / route. Haneda is a great airport and ground services are in line with any major international airport. Once onboard, one was greeted with warm smiles and friendly approachable service. In flight amenities are within expectation for J, with a (mouth) moisture mask, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush and ear plugs. Additionally a pyjama top  is also handed out sometime before or after meal service; as well as a refreshing eye moisture freshening mask before landing. Oddly though, the pyjama vest was offered to me on the day flight back but not the red eye going into TYO. As for the most crucial component of the flight, the herringbone arranged seat - cushion comfort is better than SQ though one still struggles with the non-linear layout somewhere between the pelvis (protruded by the outer front shell) and the left (or right depending on yr location) ankle position which comes into contact with the inner wall curvature. Food wise, the Japanese meal set was excellent- sushi and accompaniments were top notch and fresh. One could also enjoy premium arabica coffee, and on demand cup noodle snacks if needed. Overall, I would definitely try JAL out again simply because their service is excellent and the cabin product is in line with most of the premium Asian carriers.",Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0
Boeing 777-300,Business Class,5.0,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Tokyo Haneda to New York JFK,4.0," | JAL didn't disappoint for the most part. The check-in at Haneda was fast and accommodating. I say accommodating because they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination on American Airlines connecting flight, despite the fact that these were two separate tickets. It seems a small thing, but it was major for me as JFK is a nightmare to connect through. On top of that, the agent gave me my boarding pass for the American flight! Onboard both directions the seats were wide and comfortable. I'm very large and I didn't feel particularly cramped or hindered even when in full recline. The seat cushions themselves are a bit thin, but they do have the extra air weave pads to help with this. Looking around the cabin, you can't help but feel it needs a refresher, but it is perfectly comfortable. The service onboard was kind and fast! They have an onboard order as you like service after the main meal and the food comes to you incredibly fast. The handset ordering function for this food was broken/unavailable both directions, but the response time of the FA was speedy. The food was good and you will not starve. However, if you are particular about your diet in any way, you may wish to order special meals. The western and the Japanese meals one way both featured beef which I don't eat. With the large a la carte menu it is easy enough to work around, but I found the set menus of the first meals to be really limited. AVOD was adequate and better than I remembered. Luggage delivery on the return from JFK was very slow, even for priority service. I'll probably fly them again, especially on the Haneda flights internationally.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 787-8,Economy Class,4.0,March 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,no,Tokyo Narita to Vancouver,1.0," |  Tokyo Narita to Vancouver on Boeing 787-8 in Economy. Was looking forward to this flight but was really disappointed. The aircraft is one of the first generation 787 and although it's not that old, it felt that way onboard. IFE is using Magic V on this particular aircraft, there was limited content and only few New Releases. Response time is good on the touch screen. Food is the part that I was most excited about but it turned out to be my biggest disappointment. It was probably my high expectation based on the promise of ""Collaboratively-designed menus by 6 young talented chef"" according to their website. I appreciated the metal cutlery though. The food itself tasted bland. The side dishes are OK and the miso soup was a nice touch but oh so salty.There are only 2 meal service and the last one does not give you a choice but the Soba was ok. They also does not give the whole can of Soda unless you ask for it specifically. Flight Crew - very polite, smiles a lot and efficient. Seat felt cramped and I'm only 165CM. When the passenger in front of me reclined her seat, the backseat TV was almost touching my face. Overall, the experience was not horrible. Would I fly JAL again? Most likely if the fare is good, but will bring my own food just to be on the safe side.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan
Boeing 777-300ER,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,5.0,1.0,4.0,yes,New York to Tokyo Narita,2.0," |  New York to Tokyo Narita. Return flight, same high quality service inflight as outgoing flight. Ground service at JFK a different story. Several check-in staff members unable or unwilling to speak Japanese to Japanese passengers, slowing check-in. Even with English-speaking passengers, check-in took 3x as long as at NRT and was not thorough (security and fragile item questions skipped). Saw staff I remember from previous years’ visits still dealing with passengers like newbies. Delays here compounded delays at security (due to TSA shift change and terminal flight departure bunching). T1 requires removal of suitcase belts due to outdated conveyer equipment. Check-in gate support by same ground staff with same problems. ",Business,4.0,nan
777W,Economy Class,5.0,March 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Tokyo to New York,3.0," |  Tokyo to New York. Fast and efficient check-in at NRT; reliable, polite and thoughtful Japanese ‘omotenashi’ on-board service. FA checked with our group leader about student group member needs before departure, and followed up in flight. When they ran out of one of two dinner options at the back of the plane, I accepted what they had, but explained that I would have to eat around the main dish (curry) which contained shrimp I was allergic to. The FA asked for a few minutes, and after passing out the remaining meals, she disappeared into the galley, reappearing with a beef curry not on the menu. JAL also allows larger suitcases (203 instead of the standard 157cm). Unloading time average at JFK.",Business,5.0,nan
nan,Premium Economy,5.0,nan,1.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,4.0,My wife and I travelled London to Sydney via Narita using JAL all the way travelling Premium economy. The most disappointing aspect of the JAL flights was the very poor food - options and quality. It was substandard relative to what is available elsewhere and for the price (either in terms of FFPoints or money) of a Premium economy flight . We were disappointed. Also the in flight entertainment system gave very limited options for films. Having moved about Japan internally on occasions the food and the film options were intended more for a Japanese customer base and not for a global community of travellers.,nan,3.0,nan

Booked another flight for me with ANA from Fukuoka to Osaka Kansai early next morning reserved a hotel for me in Fukuoka arranged a taxi to bring me to Fukuoka airport gave me money for dinner/breakfast.

Both flights departed and arrived on time. Flight to Haneda was a night flight so a little snack and drink was served before the lights were switched off for a good four hours. Breakfast was a Japanese-style omelette with rice and noodles (only one option) which I did not particularly enjoy. Staff were friendly and polite throughout. The flight from Narita to Singapore was a day flight two snacks as well as a lunch were served. Service was fantastic on this flight as well and there were two options for lunch which were both quite tasty. Inflight entertainment was average the large MAGIC V touch screen was great however there was a limited number of movies and the music selection was poor compared with that on my connecting flight to Australia with Qantas. Despite some minor drawbacks where this airline excelled was its customer service which was excellent from beginning to end.

Seats were rather cramped with barely sufficient leg space but still acceptable. Cabin attendants were attentive and respond to calls promptly. Unfortunately their English proficiency was not up to standard and most of them spoke mostly in Japanese to even non-Japanese passengers. Also despite being an international flight all the announcements were made in Japanese before English. Food was palatable which comes in a main course 2-3 side dishes and fruits.

I found the seats outdated and far less comfortable than those of several Asian competitors. Briefly lost power coming into Narita which was not fun. Communication with passengers in English seems to be a challenge for the flight deck crew and seemed to be intentionally avoided. Food was generally good but nothing spectacular. The IFE on all flights was poor with limited mediocre content. All things considered JAL is barely superior to any domestic U.S. carrier but decidedly lagging behind many others on a regional and global scale.,nan,4.0,nan

However the entertainment selection was rather poor especially the movie selection for our 12 + hour flight. I wish they offered a bit more choice as far as the food selection goes.

Customer service on board was (as expected from a Japanese airline) spectacular. I'm on a gluten free diet and the stewards who were all bilingual were extremely polite and helpful. What really impressed me on this flight was the food. Bearing in mind I was in economy I didn't expect to be served two gourmet meals (by airline standards) including a steak and red wine reduction! Although this was a special gluten free meal everyone seemed impressed with the food in general which all looked very good. Without a doubt the best food I've had on a flight including business class on BA. Other than the uncomfortable seats my major complaint is the IFE which was appalling. Only a handful of English language movies of which 4 were so-called ""new releases"" and only 5 of which I'd ever heard of. There wasn't a single English language TV show on board and the Japanese programming (which was plentiful) doesn't do much for a western audience.

Food was ok but the cabin crew were helpful in doing several rounds of drinks throughout the flight. Seat was comfortable but the only negative point on it was the entertainment box was situated beneath the seat in front which limits the legroom. I suppose this applies to the window seats of their 767 fleet. Love the feeling of flying on the 767 as it feels roomier with less pax per row 7 abreast in the 767 compared to 9 abreast in the 777.

Unlike with carriers on this side of the globe the economy class food was actually quite good.

However on recent Premium Economy travel through from Sydney to Frankfurt and return I found the shell seats almost impossible for sleeping (were these cast-offs from the similar old Cathay Pacific seats one wonders?) and due to a promotional fare offer the PE cabin was packed with noisy passengers and became claustrophobic which tends to negate the benefits of flying PE in the first place! Also this must be the only airline I can think of that allows passengers to keep their window shades closed during the take-off and landing phases of the flight - half the cabin was in darkness from before taxiing and then for the entire flight including the landings. Isn't this a safety hazard when passengers are unable to see out of the aircraft in case of emergency? On the other hand I like the JAL First lounges in Narita and use of the Qantas First lounge in Sydney - excellent.

We were seated in 2C/D which would normally be business but was their special extra room seating on this plane. Seat selection was available here online for no extra charge. It was a wider cloth seat with manual buttons. Service was pleasant for an Asian legacy carrier on this route. To be honest I expected more for this high value business route. The food was a chicken and mayonnaise sandwich in a box with some rice crackers and pineapple. Very simple. We departed and arrived on time without delays. The one surprise - they put as the farthest gate in the airport. Literally. Very end of Haneda down two giant hallways that took about 15 minutes of speed walking.

In terms of service and courtesy they were spot on! The English proficiency level of the cabin crew was more than satisfactory contrary to other reviews claiming they were hard to be understood. The business class was disappointing due to three aspects uncomfortable out of date recliner seat with remote control on the arm rest which could easily be triggered wrongly. Average food (in portion and taste) and average AVOD. It was evident to see Japan airlines were trying to cut cost by not providing 3 course meal served separately all was served on one tray which was rather cramped. The toilet is basic with the absence of toiletries such as hand cream or cologne which is a norm for most business class. General temperature of the aircraft a bit on the warm side rather uncomfortable for the 4 hours duration. However on a positive note one could see cabin crew did their best with the limited resources they have been given. On the ground check in staffs both in HK and Japan were excellent lounge in HK was just a shared one and in Narita we used the Sakura lounge which is spacious and comfortable. All in all it was clear that Japan airlines had her golden days but is now struggling to survive so they concentrate on the longer routes and give only the very basic to short haul routes.

What JAL does differently though is that it immediately includes Priority Boarding status and lounge access indication on your ticket which I found helpful and convenient. A bit of a slight negative in my praise if ever so little is that the lounge at JFK has seen better days and could use some sprucing up. I must say this was one of the most pleasurable flight experiences I've had in a long time having flown so far (14 hrs straight) and in economy class. What's impressive about what JAL's done is design a standard economy seat with comfort and practicality foremost. With a pitch of 34"" this has got to be one of the most generous legrooms in coach period. JAL takes Premium Economy to the next level with a whopping 42"" and a whole slew of other amenities. Meal service was also a big plus. Two full meals and a mid-flight snack were served. The initial meal after takeoff comprised of two different types of appetizers fruit salad slaw salad and your choice of entree. Very scrumptious. The meal on my return journey on a different airline Cathay Pacific was a scant offering by comparison.

Overall the cabin was excellent with a very comfortable flat bed a decent amount of space and unobstructed access to your seat irrespective of its location. The only slight negative was the fact that the middle seat in each row (which have a 2x3x2 configuration) that I had on both legs can feel rather isolated with its high partitions either side and the over head bins above. Service at HND was excellent too benefiting from the brand new international terminal facilities. The JAL Business Class Lounge was clean comfortable and reasonably quiet. Unfortunately when leaving LHR JAL passengers have to use the BA Lounge in the terminal which is small cramped and crowded. Both flights boarded and departed on time.,nan,3.0,nan

I used to fly to BOS via ORD or IAD with UA their direct flight to Boston seemed the most attractive to me. It would shorten my trip by 5 hours. The result: superb service all around. On the return flight I skipped dinner because I couldn't resist my drowsiness. After 4 hours sleeping one of the flight attendants got me a meal plate amiably. What a service! Please remember I was in the economy cabin. The quality of inflight meal was nothing to be desired as far as it was served in economy. IFE was satisfactory to Japanese passengers however I got to know that it was not enough for native speakers of English. Seats were more than average with footrests. On-time departures and arrivals for both legs. They observed punctuality. Finally let me show you their improvement: when we were seated waiting for boarding at E3B gate of Logan JL FA's were passing by.

Inflight meal was fantastic twice the portion of any airline food in the US. The meals in JFK-NRT segments in economy class can compare to and exceed the quality of meals of any domestic flights business class meals within the United State. NRT-ICN economy class meals provided a meal box in commemoration of the 50th year of the launch of flights between Japan and Korea. The flight out of NRT was delayed because of the heavy rain and airlines are not usually responsible for weather delays but Japan Airlines provided two free shuttle from ICN to Seoul to compensate for the weather delay!

Inability to choose seats before the flight for certain booking codes is one thing but to allow it on one leg of the trip and not another is odd. After purchasing a RT ticket I was able to chose seats for the outbound flight. When I inquired about seats for the return trip I was told that the fare did not allow it. I even offered to pay to be able to select a seat and was told that I would have to pay over $600. $250 of that was a penalty for changing the ticket? Really?

The seat itself is roomy and offers excellent privacy and it folds down into a comfortable flat horizontal bed. Unfortunately JAL has a tendency to overheat the cabin which interferes with sleep. On the return trip I solved the over-heating problem by accompanying the purser to the heat control to reduce the heat from the previously set 26 degrees (which is insanely hot). Meals were ok (had the Japanese selection). Champagne was excellent the rest of the wines inferior. Oddly no breakfast available on the overnight flight back to LAX. IFE had an excellent screen and the worst selection of films one could imagine. The flights between NRT and HKG were on a 767 with simply terrible seats.

I was very satisfied with everything including cabin crew service, flight meals, seat pitch, but only except inflight entertainment system, movie selections to be specific. The movies were a little bit outdated with limited western selections, but would be ideal for Japanese passengers since half of the movies are Japanese. JAL used B767 for its NRT-PVG route, and most passengers appeared to be Chinese tourists traveling with kids. The boarding process was a bit chaotic and the flight was full. The A/C on this segment was outrageously strong, and I was frozen sitting on a window seat. The flight attendant was very considerate after I told her this problem. Again, the cabin service was excellent; meal was good, but the inflight entertainment system was a bit old but still acceptable. I would definitely fly them again, for its top-notch service.

The business class seat on the transpacific legs was excellent. Comfortable both seated and when lowered to the fully flat bed. JAL supplies a lightweight cushion so that the seat becomes softer when sleeping. JAL has a tendency to overheat their cabins. Knowing this I requested the purser on both long hauls to lower the cabin temp in our zone, which she did.  Such an improvement. Quality of the food is fine, but JAL really skimps on the SFO-HND route, evidently since in both directions the departure is after midnight. I simply ordered the Japanese breakfast right at the start of the flight and ate it then. The Haneda Sakura lounge is very modern, good food, good wifi, nice showers. Perfect and changing planes there was a pleasure. On the other hand, the San Francisco Sakura lounge is pitiful. Overcrowded, terrible food, frankly an embarrassment.

Im 6ft 5 and pretty thin so the width of the seat didn't bother me but if you are even slightly overweight I think you would find the seats uncomfortable. Service of staff on JAL is exceptional they are so wonderful happy and willing to help. This was a night flight but I didn't sleep. Also the inflight entertainment is woefully inadequate by today standards. Movies & TV shows are not on demand you have to wait until the movie/tv show restarts - very frustrating on a long haul flight. Probably wont fly again if it can be avoided.,nan,4.0,nan

Thus managed to get some seats from the back with my infant daughter. Was given packet of apple juice and disposable wet wipes. FA polite and offered more wet wipes when they saw me having a sandwich. Flight map shown during the flight. KL to Singapore was about 60% full a newer B767-300. Cushions were thinner compared to ANA Y Class. Don't think it would be comfortable for a flight for more than 6 hrs to KIX due to thin cushions.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Late night flight to Narita fully loaded 777. Despite the cramped seat pitch across their fleet I have enjoyed flying JAL. The service has been very warm efficient and polite. However the catering on this particular flight left a lot to be desired. After take off and waiting for a little over an hour - smiling flight attendants doled out a drink of choice and two small cookies. That was it - till breakfast was served a few hours later - no choice just the standard very bland congee. Also having flown on JAL the previous month having watched most of the movies available - I was a bit disappointed to find the selection of movies almost identical on this flight. So tried to catch up on sleep instead but with a short flight time breakfast was served about 4.30am. so not much sleep either. While not the best flight I've had with them I still would fly with them again - perhaps not a red eye like this one. Hope they get that cash injection from somewhere soon.,nan,4.0,nan

The food was good service was good and although there was not tons of leg room I was comfortable enough (I am only 5' 2""). The way back to Chicago from Narita was a nightmare. I had a seat next to my husband and all was fine at first till the Asian woman in front of me reclined her seat over halfway. On the flight there I had mine reclined about 1"" and when asked by a Stewardess to move it for the man behind me I did even though it was not mealtime. This woman would not move at all and the Stewardess would do nothing and even as a short person I was uncomfortably cramped. I asked the woman and the Stewardess for help but was ignored by the woman and told by the Stewardess she could do nothing. Then mealtime came they made her move and after the meal I put my pillow against the window and went to sleep. When I woke up (because I was in pain) her seat was all the way reclined and my legs were all cramped up. I asked her and the stewardess again with no result. I finally went and stood in the back of the plane and refused to sit in that seat unless the woman moved. I talked to the Stewardess explained that when asked to move I did explained I was in pain and said I paid just as much for my ticket as the other inconsiderate woman did. After standing there about 20 minutes they finally gave me a seat on the other side of the plane (which was a lot more roomy and the people over there were considerate). Nothing would have been done had I not forced the issue and I did not appreciate being treated that way. I will not fly JAL again not even in a higher class that was hands down the worst experience I ever had on a plane. I guess it is a value price if you don't mind being exceedingly uncomfortable for 14 long hours but I do mind. They only get a 5 because my flight one way was good but it is still a 50/50 gamble.",nan,4.0,nan

We travelled Premium Economy Class and there was always staff on hand to assist or offer you a drink soup or snack. Premium Economy seats are quite comfortable and have large tables. The meal service (the same as normal economy class) in both directions was good. I think they need a few more new release movies on their AVOD system and another inch or two of legroom so that it easier to slide out into the aisle when sitting at a window or middle seat.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,JAL roundtrip from Chicago to Tokyo last week. I could not believe the 777-300ER had no individual ventilation system per seat. Whatever the reason the result is that the economy section was extraordinarily hot and stuffy where my daughter and I were sitting - to the point where she got sick and had a mild asthma attack. For 12 hours I was sweating with no relief. The return plane was a bit better but very uneven. It would cool down only to get hot again for 45 minute stretches. Several passengers including myself complained about the poor ventilation and A/C. I walked all over the economy section and noticed that as I walked down an aisle I could literally feel the temperature change - the uneven cooling was that noticeable. JAL flight attendants heading to Narita were very sweet to my daughter who had to sit in the jump seat in the galley as it was significantly cooler. On the way back to Chicago the flight attendant I complained to who was serving our side of the economy section was rather argumentative saying some passengers complained they were cold and had extra blankets. Well hardly anyone in economy had them as it was easy to check. I called her out and asked her to prove this and then she shut up. I happened to casually chat with 3 other passengers on this leg who also complained about the atrocious ventilation/temperature. What is going on here? JAL's food is pretty bad and the section is cramped but I got what I paid for so no complaints. They were very efficient in their service all around even if the food was awful and the red wine I got had actually turned into vinegar. I shall never fly them again.,nan,4.0,nan

Inflight service reasonable though flight attendants used very basic even rude English with customers whom they believed could not use Japanese which was a sharp contrast to the elegant Japanese used with Japanese passengers. The economy class seats are terrible unless you are a dwarf. They do not properly recline. The seat slides forward as the back reclines so the legs hit the seat in front: quite unsuitable for a 12-hour flight. Magic III was fair with a rather limited selection available.,nan,4.0,nan

The flight to Bangkok was an early evening flight which was quite reasonable. The plane was clean and recently refurbished updated IFE and new covers for economy seats. We ordered the vegetarian meal which was reasonable. The seats were newer and wider which was a vast improvement on the older planes JAL still uses. Service was fine when you asked for it but FAs were not very attentive. IFE was fine and had some good movies. The plane on the return journey was much older seats older and narrower design. Not very comfortable but had plenty of leg space as my wife and I got exit seats. This flight was overnight and we got little sleep and didn't eat anything as we were too tired. My wife was feeling queasy for the whole flight but the FA who was sitting opposite us went beyond the call of duty and constantly asked if there was anything she could do to make my wife more comfortable - she gave us extra blankets and chatted to us during the flight.,nan,4.0,nan

Adequate for daytime flight only. The Magic-III inflight entertainment system worked - however I was disappointed by the range and selection of movies available. The in-flight service differed dramatically. On our flight to Narita we had a wonderful crew led by a Thai-based purser - hard working always in the cabin and a wonderful inflight experience which made up for the substandard cabin. On our return it was the opposite. The service was chaotic and disorganised. The business cabin was full and it was over 2 hours after boarding before we were even offered a drink. This is an overnight flight departing Narita ~2130 so the entire meal service should have been completed by 2 hours into the flight to ensure we had sufficient time to rest. However we hadn't even been offered a drink. We were exhausted after travelling in from Los Angeles so my partner walked down to the galley and requested a snack and a bottle of water. This was promptly provided for us but you could tell our request was not appreciated. The cabin temperature was hot during both flights and the air quality seemed stuffy and overly dry. Requests to lower the air temperature was denied as I was quoted ""that the Japanese passengers feel the cold"".

Not so good was the food in Premium Economy - minuscule tasteless portions of poor quality especially to and from Australia. I can recall wonderful Japanese food even in basic economy 10 years ago on JAL. An odd aspect is that JAL seemed not to be able to recognise my OneWorld Emerald details and status until I complained on check-in on each leg.

This cabin is a well-priced alternative to economy in theory contains shell-style seats good IFE etc. My biggest complaint is related to legroom. Although Premium Economy has more advertised legroom than Economy due to the presence of large metal boxes (presumably supporting the IFE) under the seat in front of me I couldn't fully extend my legs which made it hard to sleep hence negating the value proposition. I did notice these boxes throughout the cabin so suspect it wasn't just my seat. And I'm neutral to negative on the shell seat as well. Yes it is nice that nobody is reclining in your face but the slide is awkward and I don't find it terribly comfortable. Food in Premium Economy much more akin to Economy than Business.

How refreshing after the take-it-or-leave-it attitude on most US- based carriers! 787 was a nice experience with the oversized windows which darken at the touch of a button and the ride is slightly quieter than other aircraft's but cannot see that the individual passenger experience is greatly improved.

Overall, flying with JAL was a good experience. The legroom in economy class was plentiful and the seats were comfortable. Flight attendant service was good as well and there was a decent selection of movies to watch on seat back monitors. My complaint is that the food on flights between SF to Tokyo didn't seem adequate for a 10 hour flight, which is long. They provided 1 full meal and 1 little dinky (tiny!) sandwich with no condiments, so remember to bring snacks. The lack of condiments on the sandwich and the fact that it was cold made it extremely dry and barely edible. On the other hand, the full meal they served were good, my only complaint being that they did not heat up the bread rolls. I've flown on many trans pacific flights between the US and Asia with other airlines and they have always provided 2 full meals.

They were not only extremely friendly, quick and punctual, the seats were comfortable the crew had some humor, the entertainment system was easy to use (no annoying pressing 100 times until the movie plays) and the window brightness could be regulated which was an amazing alternative to the blinds in case one wants to sleep but the other wants to enjoy the view. Controllable sunglasses for the window - first time I saw that. Also they served some nice and good food including Milka chocolate, ice cream from Häagen Dasz and a ""Bauer"" yoghurt. We all know these are great brands. The service couldn't be better - and always a smile on their face, which makes you feel even better while travelling. The poor English didn't bother me at all.

Wi-fi only available gratis in Business or First Class, or for a charge if you are in Premium Economy or Economy providing you have an account with JAL. Catering was of a good standard, with reasonable selection of food, drinks and snacks. Flight was smooth, with pleasant climate maintained inside the aircraft. Arrival was ahead of schedule and disembarkation was well organised. Overall, having experienced Premium Economy (PE) with CX, I found the JAL PE to be sub-standard. Apart from the PE seats in JAL and a separate check-in counter, the catering, baggage allowance, etc.. is exactly the same as Economy. Considering the new Economy seats in JAL, I believe Economy is much better value for money. Maybe CX PE experience has spoiled me!

The JAL system would not allow me to complete check-in, advising I had to contact my travel agent. This was bizarre, as my ticket was purchased from JAL direct! At Narita Airport I was directed to the Premium Economy check-in. When I presented myself at the counter to which I was directed, the staff  told me they were closed, and took me to another counter which was also closed! Staff subsequently turned up and completed my check-in, however, the check-in process was disorganised. Flight departed on schedule. Food quality was of a poor standard. I had expected better from JAL when departing from their home base. I had also expected to find some typical Japanese dishes on the menu, but they were absent. Flight was not comfortable, as the crew had the climate turned up and it was way too hot and made it too uncomfortable to sleep. Most passengers in PE were visibily hot, as people removed all but necessary clothing and didn't use the aircraft blankets - requests for reduction in cabin temperature were ignored. Initially I presumed that to acclimatise us to the colder weather in Sydney they would reduce cabin temperature as we approached Sydney, the ambient temperature in Sydney being 6C. However, this was not the case. I was still sweating when I left the terminal and went into the open air. Flight arrived on schedule, however, disembarkation was very slow to be implemented and seemed disorganised. I understand that First and Business Class have priority, however, there was a long delay to allow others to disembark after all the First and Business class passengers had long since disappeared into the terminal.

It does use Narita as opposed to Haneda, but JAL certainly makes up for the slight inconvenience due to the distance to the city. Firstly their fare is cheaper than Qantas, and even the Jetstar flight via the Gold Coast. Secondly their luggage allowance is more generous (23kg x 2 check-in) so it was a nice surprise to be able to relax at the airport baggage-free. Thirdly their staff, both ground and air, were so competent. They were efficient and knew not to disturb you unnecessarily, while keeping the signature Japanese Omotenashi mind. Also they serve you plenty of drinks and quality food, with warm breakfast. I did think the flavour was too much to the Japanese liking (e.g. they served rice-featured breakfast and no other options, if I'm not mistaken), but it was one of the best economy class meals around.  could not stress more how wonderful the spaciousness of the ""JAL Sky Wider"" seat arrangement was.  The only complaint is the range of movies and TV shows shown. Qantas offers more alternatives than JAL and ANA's typical blockbusters and Friends.

Also, I could fly into my hometown of San Diego rather than the usual grind of landing in LA and driving south. From the start, I had high expectations that were never quite met. The flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was short and unmemorable which is interesting, because I always enjoy the Shanghai to Tokyo flight on ANA. I had higher hopes for the Tokyo - San Diego flight based not the least on the airframe, the B787 Dreamliner. This is my favorite plane. I typically try to exclusively fly this if possible due to the reduce noise, lower pressurization and, typically, newer configured cabins. For JAL, the latter was a huge let down. Not that the cabin was old. It was very new, but the seats were the reclining type, not the lay-flat and in today's business class, that is simply not competitive for a 12 hour flight. Outside of the seat's limited recline, the overall pod was comfortable with storage in all the right places. The entertainment system was also very good. Overall, it was a comfortable seating area, but with no lay-flat, when it was time to sleep, JAL failed. While I was awake, though, the service was excellent. The attendants were attentive and professional and were always around to help. The food was very good, as well. I can see why JAL is rated well as an airline, but the absence of lay-flat seats will put them out of the running for me as a carrier. It is too bad, as I frequently fly to China from San Diego and JAL would be hugely convenient.",Business,3.0,nan

After take-off, light snack, bread, and drinks were offered. A bottle of mineral water was offered to each passenger too.

Good flight, on time, clean cabin on the 787 Dreamliner, my first flight on this acclaimed aircraft. The notable innovation is the window shade is electronically block out/open. Meal is OK, nothing special, but very Japanese. Staff service attitude is good but their language ability is limited. Even airport custom officers do not really speak English. An efficient and satisfactory flight.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
Boeing 787,Business Class,3.0,October 2016,2.0,4.0,3.0,no,SIN to HND,3.0, | As this flight leaves Singapore after 1am there is no meal served after take off. In fact it was difficult to even get a drink. Whilst the flat beds are relatively comfortable they are also very narrow. The choice of breakfast served before arrival in Haneda was either Japanese or western. I opted for the western but the meal bore no resemblance whatsoever to a western breakfast and was mostly inedible. The overall service level was average at best. For the return flight to Singapore we flew from Narita but as in the same flight taken earlier this year the plane was almost an hour late in departing due to heavy traffic around 6pm. Passengers should also be reminded that the walk from the JAL lounge is around 15 minutes as the gate used for this flight is the furthest away on the particular pier that's used. The flight itself was acceptable although the food selection is not great. Moreover my wife was served half an before me even though our food order was taken at the same time. All in all not a great experience so next time we visit Japan we will be giving JAL a miss.,Business,3.0,3.0

During the 4 hour flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda, all cabin attendants were very proactive in helping passengers. They did not only serve with smile but I could feel their passion in caring on every passenger and their attention to details. The aircraft was equipped with SkySuite III with excellent cabin condition, including lie flat seat and huge personal TV screen. Slippers and other amenities were provided. All ground staff in HKG were very professional and well trained.

Compared to Premium Economy on some airlines, JAL seems to provide more space, with a hard but quite comfortable seat, a big table and entertainment screen, and a good legrest that really helped provide support. I can't usually sleep much on flights but on this one slept for around 5 hours. Food is standard economy (with a few extras such as champagne) but good in terms of both quantity and quality. The plane seemed new and was kept clean throughout, and there were useful extras such as mouthwash available in the toilets. I would definitely fly Japan Airlines again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

Before my flight I had a few questions about my booking so I decided to email them. I was surprised that I got answer the following day! Same goes for the phonecall. I called since I had a codeshare ticket, and the online check-in did not work for me. I expected to be waiting on the line, and was so surprised when a very cheerful woman answered after a few seconds! It was my first long-haul solo flight and I felt a bit anxious. Without saying anything to the staff, they would check on me very often, making sure I was comfortable. The staff was very competent, and spoke Japanese, English, and German.

I had arrived early at the airport and they let me choose my seat on the plane. The Japanese staff are world class! It was my first time flying across the Pacific and they made my flight very comfortable. The cabin crew were very attentive, helpful and accommodating. The food was good, there was no charge for liquor and the lavatory was fairly clean. Great selection of movies to pass the time.

Both legs (Haneda-Bangkok, Bangkok-Haneda) were red-eye flights. The quality of catering was much better on the outbound flight (HND-BKK). However, there were no choices on both legs. I really think Japan Airlines should provide meal choices for their passengers. Service-wise, the crew on both flights (BKK-HND) were indifferent and not really friendly towards the passengers. There were Bangkok-based crew as well, and there is a big difference among the Bangkok-based crew. Some were really good but some were not so friendly.",Business,3.0,3.0

The attention to detail by its ground staff and cabin attendants was exceptional. There were both Hong Kong and Japan based cabin attendants and they were providing excellent service. The aircraft did not have the Sky Wider seats but the seats were still very comfortable for a regional flight. Quality of inflight meals was very good although there was no option.

Flight was okay in business class on Boeing 777, not my chosen airline but paid for by client. I have used ANA on previous London/Tokyo trips and ANA are superior to Japan Airlines, they seem more international and staff are much nicer. Check in and lounge in Tokyo was efficient (lounge rather crowded), seat onboard Boeing 777 was comfortable, but cabin temperature was unbearably hot and stuffy (to suit Japanese passengers). Food was passable (again, well below ANA), inflight entertainment is poor. Clean cabin, poor washrooms (no amenities at all). I can see what ANA is 5-Star compared to Japan Airlines.",Business,3.0,3.0

When I was boarding, there was two flight attendants standing by the door to greet and apologise for the delay to the passengers. After take off, dinner was served. I would say Japan Airlines has a good selection of meals in economy class. The FAs on this flight was attentive and helpful. The IFE screen on my seat wasn't working, so the FA reseated me. Prior to landing, a Japanese style breakfast was served on board. It was delicious. Overall, I would say that this flight was awesome thanks to cabin crew. Good job.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

I was greeted at the door of the aircraft and ushered left to seat 1A. I was instantly served Salon 2006 Champagne and shortly afterwards offered leisure clothing of my size, and offered that opportunity to change into it before departure. The bathroom had a padded drop-down floor and seat so that you didn’t have to stand on the floor or toilet to change! Then all five staff working in First Class bowed and introduced themselves, and the Japanese 9-cousre menu started shortly after take-off. Many fine champagnes and sakis were offered and enjoyed, as well as the offer of the entire Japanese menu after mentioning that I had not tried many Japanese cuisines. As there were only two people occupying the 8-seat First Class cabin, the crew made up the suite opposite into a bed for me so I could sleep when it suited me. After about 3 hours of sleep they asked me if I wanted more food and drink. Nearing arrival, I was presented with a bag containing a Business Class amenity kit (having complimented them on the First Class Porsche Design kit, and they wanted me to have a Zero Halliburton one), some Japanese photos and two bottles of water for my onward journey.

Seats were quite confortable although rather narrow for sleeping, and the cabin was overheated for non Japanese passengers, but staff don't seem to care. I have now flown this route with LH, ANA and Japan Airlines, and have to say that Japan Airlines are below standards of others. Cabin attendants speak very poor English (they have foreign CA), and the service is so slow and rather poor. I didn't expect them to be this poor, and a long way behind their rival ANA (who I will choose on next trip). ",Business,2.0,3.0

I purchased the ticket on this flight with the Visit Japan Fare option, it allows you to travel within japan on a flat fare of $100 per person one way. The only condition is you must be a foreigner living outside Japan with a passport to prove it. A friendly welcome was provided and cabin interior was clean and modern. Seats were leather and slim, yet very comfortable. Flight was only about 90 minutes and we were given a choice of juice, coffee or tea; no sodas. I was the only tourist on the flight and the FA did not speak English, so she handed me a menu with english translations of what they had to offer.

Boeing 777 / 787,Premium Economy,5.0,August 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes,Tokyo to Honolulu,4.0," |  Tokyo to Honolulu. This trip to Hawaii I splashed out on their premium economy. It is a great value considering the services provided. You get designated check-in, priority luggage check, and access to the Sakura Lounge at Narita. Because it was a late night flight, people like myself were eating full meals in the lounge in order to skip the late night dinner service onboard. Plenty to choose from: teriyaki chicken over rice, their famous beef curry over rice, dim sum, soup, sandwiches, and Thai curry were some of the choices. We also got a massage and a shower in before boarding the aircraft. Of course, people did eat on board, too, which consisted of a posh Tokyo ""yoshoku"" chain called Shiseido Parlour and while I didn't eat anything, the meals definitely looked better than your average economy meal. The seats are a little hard after 5 hours and the recline is the slide type which many people dislike, but since I can't sleep on planes anyway, it didn't bother me. There is ample space both in width and in leg room. The service is flawless. The AVOD was adequate. A smooth flight going over. Coming back, the 787 was even better. The toilet in economy with a washlet was a welcome treat. There were two babies traveling in the front row of premium and they were treated like kings! The older flight attendants doted over them the entire flight with special meals, chatting, games and toys, and of course bassinets. The power port at my seat didn't work, and the wifi on offer never seemed to either. I'm now a regular with JAL and I don't think I'll be changing anytime soon.",Couple Leisure,5.0,1.0

I usually fly premium or business, but since the flight was only 3 hours 40 minutes going down and 3 hours coming back, I decided to save money and fly economy. At Haneda, the economy check-in line was long but moved rather quickly. The staff were professional and it was running smoothly. The crew onboard were wonderful on both legs. The food was good quality. I'm XXL and legroom is usually a problem, but it wasn't so bad on this aircraft. However, the seats seem a bit low and there was blockage under the seat with AVOD boxes, so it wasn't really comfortable overall. The cushions were thin. The aircraft is a 787, but it must be one of the oldest! If you paid for a staggard, lie-flat bed in business, you'd be sorely disappointed as they are the old neo shell seats. The interior was not the great ""wider seats"" they advertise and the AVOD was rather limited. I think if you are Japanese (or are fluent in Japanese) you'd be happy, but it was a rather lame assortment of major Hollywood blockbuster features with few interesting selections. All in all, I had a pleasant and easy trip on JAL and I look forward to flying them in premium economy in the future.",Business,4.0,nan

I was 32 weeks pregnant at the time of travelling and without me asking for any assistance all the staff I encountered were genuinely hospital, diligent & attentive. The lady who helped me at the transfer desk in Narita airport led me to a seat so I could sit down while she processed my request. And cabin crew on board came and spoke to me at different times of the flight to ask how I was feeling and if I needed anything. As the flight wasn't full they also asked the lady next to me to move to the next seat over to give us both extra room - she was happy to oblige. At the end of the flight, I was given a little gift for my new baby which had some toys and also a little JAL model plane. The crew had written a personal message to me offering their congratulations with all the details of that days flight written on it - a lovely keepsake. The food is of a high standard for airline food and they presented a picture menu so you could make your decision more easily. The toilets were kept clean and well stocked.

I got my class of service upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the time of check in for nominal charges. The seats of the aircraft was very nice and the cabin was very clean. Some negative things to note. The food. The menu was introduced to have been developed by Naomi Iijima, a food ""designer"". I had a small bite of everything and none of them was acceptable. Though ""designed"" to look fancy, everything tasted terrible. I'd say ""regular"" meal that you'd expect on economy class by other airlines would be far better. Cabin Attendants English was not good. Very unclear and hard to understand. The attitude of CA towards passengers was not something that worth a compliment.

The cabin attendants from Tokyo to Dallas were all outstanding. They did not only smile but cared for every passenger genuinely.

I had 2 hours layover at this airport to go to Ho Chi Minh city January 22, 2018. Around 5:30 pm we all were boarding and ready to depart but for some reason the airplane couldn’t fly any where and we were stuck inside for 5 hours then the pilot announced our fly is canceled. Our airplane went back to the terminal but the door couldn’t open because too much snow. So it took another one hour to get out off JAL airplane to go back to the terminal. We all got one sleeping bag, one bottle of water and a small bag of cracker for the night because of the snow storm. In the morning around 8 am we got in line to re book our ticket but all of employee at Narita airport told us we have to call JAL or book online because we were customer of yesterday they couldn’t help us in person. It’s was very disappointed with the way they handle there customers. Then we got in line to put our name and get number to get drawing at 3 pm the second day to see who is the lucky one can fly out. It’s seem like we all refugee waiting list to go back to wherever country. I was lucky that I met an Idian couple when I was charging my phone and later the husband help me to call local JAL to book my last seat at Haneda aiport which is one an half hour away by bus. My phone has international plan but couldn’t call local JAL number and 1800 JAL number took me hours but still no one pick up the phone. We were unlucky with the drawing so have to stay another night to get in to the waiting list at 4 pm fight for January 24,2018. The people at help desk gave us one night hotel which is 2 hours away. I asked the worker at help desk if my 3 friends they don’t want to go to the hotel that night could they have voucher for food instead but they no. I felt so bad for them because they have to stay another night at Narita airport with the same set of clothes. Any way there was a few nice employee try to help us by the end, one ask her boss to give me $30 to take bus to go to other airport to get the fly at 1:30 am. I was so tired because of two nights no sleep and stress out because I have 6 days left for my vacation. That’s was a very bad experience with the way JAL treat their customer.

There was no queue at check-in, immigration was smooth and Narita T2 seemed a little quiet after the Passport Control. Upon arriving at Gate 84, it was even quieter, and boarding was orderly and strictly conducted according to oneworld membership tier and class of travel. JAL’s 788 V2 (SS8) has a generous 2-4-2 configuration in Economy, with 18.9” Seat Width and 33” Seat Pitch. The rear section has 88 seats, which easily composes a relaxed cabin ambience, especially when it was only one third full. IFE was sensitive to touch, sophisticated and loaded with international and classic titles. In-flight Wi-Fi service has three prices when paying by normal credit card, US$10.15 for 1 hour, US$14.40 for 3 hours and US$18.80 for 24 hours. If you are paying with a JAL Card, the prices are US$9.15, US$12.95 and US$16.80 respectively. Asked one Cabin Crew in particular a specific loading question, she was visibly annoyed. The Cabin Manager noticed the situation and personally came to apologise for the ‘service attitude’ and gave me a small present from the Captain. For the remainder of the journey, I received unprecedented and somewhat uncomfortable levels of pampering attentions from the crew members. Two meals were served after takeoff with five or six types of grain or chocolate made snacks readily available between meals. The first full meal was designed by JAL’s one of six RED U-35 Cooks, including Kazutoyo Inoue from Szechwan Restaurant Chen.
