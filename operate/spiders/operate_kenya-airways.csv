Hitherto we have used British Airways because they happen to fly direct to Entebbe but now we will always use their Nairobi connection even though there is a stop off.

On the upside access to Air France Lounge New Dreamliner with flat beds good pillows and big warm blankets great entertainment service was very good and the food was fine.

The plane really is the best airliner in the sky right now quiet w/ photochromatic adjustable oversized windows excellent air circulation and higher humidity. As for Kenya Airways they made these two flights extremely comfortable with great food excellent South African wines great lay flat seats (2+2+2 configuration) very adequate inflight AV and very caring services presentation.

The seat back entertainment was fairly limited. The food and beverage service was extremely slow. Bearing in mind that the flight departed at 20.40 the service did not begin for at least 2 hours after take off. Cabin crew was pleasant and helpful. My return flight was on the Dreamliner. The seat pitch and width were OK however the seat itself is very hard I had to use the small pillow they provide to sit on. I can't say that I noticed a huge difference between the Dreamliner and the 777 other that the size of the aircraft. If I was doing that route again I would consider flying with KQ.,nan,2.0,nan

The meal small but tasty and there was some IFE on the seat back TVs. The plane seemed quite new and the staff efficient and smiling. Punctuality was also excellent. An even bigger surprise was the new modern airport at Nairobi. We were transferred quickly onto the London flight and although it was an older 777 it was not full so there were many spare seats at the back. Again we were on time getting to London.

nan,First Class,1.0,December 2014,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,Douala to Dubai via NBO,2.0,"I don't even know where to start. I lost two days of my vacation due to flight delays from Douala to Dubai and Kenyan Airways gave the worst experience so far. When I was checking-in at the counter, I was quite pleased with a very helpful local ground staff. Before I left, I gave him 5000 CFA as a tip. The flight was delayed 6 hours so I checked in late as well. Suddenly, the staff was asking furiously for additional money because his superior saw him receiving a tip and he had to share the tip with others (couldn't believe) this really happened. He was bugging me in the most creepy way possible so I just decided to give another 5000 and left.  I was supposed to leave Douala at 1PM but we were only informed at around 4PM that they had to check us in overnight because there were some mechanical glitches with their plane. They checked us in at 2-star hotel in Douala for twin sharing-room! The room was like crate. We were finally picked up by van and we headed back to the airport. We boarded one hour late and because we were delayed for one day and I had a couple of connecting flights, my entire flight schedule got messed up. It seemed we were hostaged - not being histrionic but that was the feeling. They didn't issue a new plane ticket and asked us to claim the next ticket in Nairobi. So when we were supposed to catch the next flight from Nairobi to Dubai, we were a few minutes late and we weren't able to catch the flight. After 30 minutes of looking for somebody who can provide us information on how do we board the next flight, we were finally advised that we had to stay overnight in Nairobi and check-in at the hotel - again. There were three of us who were supposed to fly to Dubai. We insisted that they book us Etihad as it was the closest flight that time. They told us that they couldn't book another airline because it would be more expensive for them. They advised us instead that we could book and reimburse the expenses from them (yes, so if you like taking chances, one can consider). So we finally settled to stay overnight after they told us that we would be billeted on a 5-star hotel. We finally arrived at the ""5-star hotel"" only there was no air-conditioning. Yes, a hotel without an AC but a fan. We left Nairobi the following day and flew to Dubai. As soon as I get to Dubai, I requested my travel agent to cancel my return flight and reimburse me with my return flight. They offered instead that they would upgrade my cabin class to business for my return trip. The return trip had minimal delays and the business class experience was ok. But when I landed in Douala my luggage was missing! They told us that our luggage were left behind in Nairobi so we will have to wait the next day to get our luggage. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0

After an 8hr+ flight, they had a 6 hour wait for connection for 12.35pm. Then when it was about 1.30h to go, it was cancelled without any sensible reason. Having been tired, I was angry by their lack of communication. They compensated with a hotel booking about 20-30min away. The hotel was comfortable and had excellent services. We were taken back to the airport for a 10pm flight naturally expecting to be in Lilongwe by just after midnight. To my horror this wasn't a direct flight, but was going through Zimbabwe first then back to Lilongwe (no sense in this whatsoever). To make it worse, it didn't leave until 11.15pm. During all this there was no apology or anything. I've noticed this is becoming very common with their flights to Malawi apparently where they cancel or delay without thought. I regret not buying insurance because I would have claimed. For a such a good airline doing well for Africa, it's really a pity.

When we arrived at Johannesburg Airport we were faced with a huge set of scales placed in front of the check in counter that also had its own usual scales. We had to have our bags weighed and the very over officious clerk refused to take my bags as one was 3kg overweight never mind the fact that my other bag was 4kg under weight. I would have understood the concerns if the total of my bags were overweight but they weren't and despite my appeals for a more common sense approach and despite my bags being identically packed to the outward journey (where they were checked in at Heathrow with no problem) I had to repack my luggage on the check in floor. This in my view is a totally ridiculous rule that appears to only be applied at Johannesburg (I have flown Kenya Airways from London, Mombasa and Nairobi on several occasions without any inconvenience). On the flight to Nairobi they again ran out of food choices and we were served by a very rude steward who just slammed the food if you can call it that down in front of us. When we arrived in Nairobi they were bussing those ending their journey there to the terminal but there were no directions for those transitting, we managed to find an emergency exit and took that and were lucky to find a very impatient Kenya Airways employee who directed us to cross a busy airport road in the dark. There was no pedestrian crossing markings and she had no high vis gear on, we were lucky not to get run down by a bus that came around the corner suddenly. The onward flight to Heathrow passed without further incident however the breakfast served was appalling, a piece of unidentifiable gristle in the dish, truly the worst meal I have ever been served in over 50 years of flying. Kenya Airways standards on this showing have definitely slipped to well below par and they need to take note.",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
Boeing 787,Business Class,5.0,March 2016,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,LHR to EBB via NBO,4.0,"Flew from London Heathrow to Entebbe via Nairobi. Arrived early for check-in but then had to wait because one of the desks was being occupied by a family who were not travelling business but seemed to be negotiating over buying another ticket. I had booked both tickets and had selected adjoining seats but by the time we had checked in these have been changed. Even though I had paid for the tickets, I was told that I could not be told whether my travelling companion was still sitting next to me – data protection etc. in fact he had been put elsewhere. It was only at the gate that we managed to correct the problem. The aircraft was a newish Boeing 787 Dreamliner and although Kenya Airways had not opted for a more modern seat configuration, it was a relatively comfortable. A slightly larger pillow would have been appreciated. My IFE was not working (photo) although given that I wanted to sleep I was not particularly worried. The cabin crew apologised for not having a printed menu and instead let the passengers look at what appeared to be an email with the food options. The wine was uninspiring and the food lacklustre. However, the cabin crew were excellent: some of them had a slightly mischievous sense of humour, smiling and responded quickly to requests. Arriving at Nairobi was a disaster. First, the aircraft had to be towed in because of construction work and we were then put on a bus and taken to the arrivals terminal. There were no signs for transit passengers and when we asked, we were told that we had arrived at the wrong place. Needless to say nobody bothered to tell us. We then went on another bus and after an absurdly long wait finally got through security. The business lounge in Nairobi was small and we were forced to share a table. We decided to leave early and, eventually, the next flight, to Entebbe, was called. Absolutely no priority was given to business passengers. Although there was a separate line, passengers simply joined whichever was the shortest and the staff did nothing to ensure that those who had paid a premium were given priority treatment. We realise that running an airline involves juggling numerous different priorities and not every airline can aspire to the standards of Emirates or Qatar Airways, but with a little effort, and a negligible cost, Kenya Airways could have done considerably better than this.",Business,2.0,nan

Some friends and I decided to take a short trip to Zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days. Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airways counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. This was a lie. We waited a bit and went to another desk and the person there found a flight leaving that evening and though we still spent more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. When leaving the airport from Zanzibar on the return flight Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, they told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. To make the long story shorter, we were stuck in the airport until after midnight before we were moved to a hotel then returned the next morning for an afternoon flight - which was of course delayed a couple times. The flight attendants were wonderful though none of the entertainment systems worked on the flight.

The minute we arrived with lateness we asked some official in the airport where to go. They pointed us towards the connections area up some stairway. We proceeded to the Kenya Airways desk, the staff were a bit clueless as to what to do until we were told to go to another desk, who in turn told us to talk to BA. After bouncing around a few desks (running) we knew we were not going to make our flight and our luggage would be left in the collection belt. We decided to miss the flight and try for a later one. The Kenya Airways staff were absolutely unhelpful. When trying to purchase the tickets we were sent to another desk, guess what, they don't take cards. And the tickets were 320$ each. At this desk we were finally told the only way to sort this was to go through immigration, collect our luggage, go to the other terminal to another Kenya Airways desk, buy our tickets then check in. In my lifetime of travelling, this was one of the most gruelling and awful experiences I have ever had. After collecting our luggage and walking outside being accosted by random ""officials"" trying to make a quick buck and people trying to scam us we made our way to the Kenya Airways office. They then offered us a pair of tickets which were now $420 each, apparently our no show on the flight we missed incurred a fee. They were taking advantage of the situation despite none of this being our fault, and only due to their incompetence. We had no choice but to buy the tickets and move on.

We originally booked our Johannesburg to Bangkok tickets via Nairobi because of the short travelling time - there was only a 1-1.5 hour layover in Nairobi each way. Months after booking the ticket, Kenya Airways rescheduled our flights so that there was a 7 hour layover in Nairobi. The 7 hour layover ended up 5 hours longer than expected because the flight to Bangkok was severely delayed (this after our flight to Nairobi had been delayed by 2 hours and used a different aircraft that did not have in flight entertainment). The 5 hour delay severely impacted our plans in Thailand, creating great inconvenience and forcing us to make additional travel arrangement to the island we were staying on, at our own expense. When we raised these concerns with the Kenya Airways service desk at Nairobi airport, we were told that they could not assist us and we had to log a complaint with Kenya Airways customer service. My partner logged a complaint - we have still had no reply to this. We faced the same experience on our return flights - the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi was delayed by 3 hours which meant we missed our connecting flight to Johannesburg and were put on the next flight out - another 7 hour wait at Nairobi airport. Then we were notified that we had been moved to a later flight that evening because a smaller aircraft had to be used. When we eventually arrived back in Johannesburg, my partner's bag had been left in Nairobi. The agent at the Kenya Airways luggage desk told us it would be couriered to us the next morning - it was only delivered at 10pm the next night. Our flights with Kenya Airways ended up being the worst travel experience of any airline - we ended up spending over 20 hours extra at Nairobi airport as well as 5 hours extra at Johannesburg and Bangkok airports due to KQ delays - an entire day of our holiday lost due to their inefficiencies.

Instead they said that there was no evidence that I brought the item onboard therefore they could not do anything to help, no form that I could fill in for lost items, no documentation for an insurance claim, just a short, rude reply from their customer services which made me think that this was not the first time that this had happened and that I should make other potential Kenya Airways customers aware of this - if you leave something of value on the plane in Nairobi, don't expect to get it back.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

Passengers in Business class are treated fairly well. An amenity kit is given (which contains a toothbrush, socks, a pen, a comb, and an eye mask) which is nice. Hot towels are provided at certain points during the flight including upon boarding. The lounge at Nairobi is also quite good. Kenya Airways has a very nice layout of the Airport for Business Class passengers, I had no queues, a very smooth process. Overall, a nice experience. Would've been excellent if technical issues were diagnosed before the flight to avoid delays; and I do hope KQ improves its on-time performance.",Family Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,3.0,April 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,no,Lusaka to Paris via Nairobi,3.0," |  My Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to Paris (a codeshare with Air France) was delayed and eventually left 14 h after the scheduled time. We had to queue for almost an hour at 1.30 am to get a voucher for a taxi as they were all written by hand and we were not given a hotel voucher, just told to go to a hotel (which very kindly took us in based on our word that our flight was delayed). We did not collect our luggage. We were told by KQ staff at the airport that we would be collected at 11 am the following day. The next morning I looked at my booking on the internet to see that the plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am. I took a taxi to the airport from the city and when I checked in I was told that the plane was leaving at 11 am. I got the same message at the boarding gate where they were getting ready to accept passengers. The airport staff seemed not to be aware that there were 200+ passengers in hotels in Nairobi. We had to wait for them to arrive. We were then told to go to gate 13 but the plane was at gate 14. We left 14 hours late. Kenya Airways staff made no public announcements during the whole of this shambles, and no apology was given until we heard from the pilot that passengers had to be collected from Nairobi. The staff at the gate seemed leaderless and unable to communicate with the many anxious passengers who had missed their connecting flights and would not arrive in Paris until 9 pm, too late to get anywhere. I had to pay for a hotel in Paris and then continue my journey by train the next day.",Business,3.0,nan

Boeing 787-8,Business Class,1.0,March 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,no,Nairobi to Amsterdam ,4.0," |  Flew the day flight Kenya Airways from Nairobi to Amsterdam in the new Boeing 787 and I am really not impressed. The 787 is certainly an improvement in comfort and reduce negative effects of flying, but the Business Class of Kenya Airways is just no match for the price, which is 40% more than competition. All in the service is just behind. Lie flat seat is ok but already look old after couple of years, and the conception is already ancient (manual handset with a wire). Service is just too basic for the price you pay, and the staff is pretty cold, un-attentive and seem bored every time you ask something (not all of them, there are couple of pursers really doing it right, but the rest is awful). I am not asking much as flying is a commodity but a minimum of politeness when coughing up 5,000 USD for a 7h flight is a fare expectations, as the level of service is nowhere representative of that. Premium Economy in some European carriers is actually better service for 1/3 of the fare. Meal service is quite basic, you get the plates and in 5 min they are taken out. The cabin is ok but already looks old. Nothing like you should expect in light of the fares charged on this route, and the contrast with KLM is just obvious",Business,1.0,nan

I was taking a school group to Africa and originally was trying to fly Ethiopian or Qatar, but both were booked out so we went with Kenya Airways. We were met at Suvarnabhumi Airport by an agent of the airline as we were a group and check-in was very smooth. Their Boeing 787 seems to have more pitch than others I have flown and so was much more comfortable for me with longer legs on an overnight flight. Flight crew to Nairobi were all African (I specify this as the Nairobi to Bangkok return flight they were all Asian as the flight continues to Hong Kong) and were very professional and provided good service. As the flight originated in China, most passengers on board when we boarded were Chinese and so were typically noisy during the flight, but no more than I have gotten used to! Food was good and served punctually. I even slept a bit during the flight - unusual for me! Overall I recommend them as a cheaper flight to Africa.",Business,5.0,nan

The inbound aircraft from Nairobi was late into Heathrow, we had to briefly go back to the gate with a maintenance issue. One of my reading lights didn't work but these things happen with airlines. The crew was great, the cabin was spotless and meal delicious. They held the connecting flight to Mombasa for me, something that airlines promise but rarely do. That flight had a newish aircraft, charming crew and clear flight deck announcements. They served a warm breakfast, not bad for a 45 minute flight. KQ were equally good on a flight to London a couple of years ago after I slipped a disc and had to be taken home in a wheelchair. I was looked after perfectly until I reached Heathrow. My only criticism is the fault of Kenya Airports Authority. It is unbelievable in the 21st century that to get to JKIA's domestic terminal, you have to push your heavy luggage cart across an enormous car park with kerbs, busy traffic and dubious individuals who want to relieve you of your luggage temporarily - or perhaps permanently. There is no reason not to have a level, paved, lit, signposted pathway - after all if Kenya can get Chinese contractors to finish a brand new railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi with gleaming new stations and viaducts six months early, they can't prevail on the Chinese to build a simple path in a week - if the work is too onerous to do themselves, that is. Or would that deprive freelance porters of income? The car park trek is a huge disincentive to use KQ to domestic destinations in Kenya - it's easier, but not such a pleasant experience, to use Turkish or Ethiopian which fly direct and clear customs at your destination.",Solo Leisure,3.0,nan

They always overbook a flight so we were the unlucky ones who have to take a flight four hours later, with zero consideration for the inconvenience caused. There will be no compensation as they booked us on SAA (this again was our fault). We insisted on lunch, which was a burger only because Kenyan Airways policy does not buy sides. We were informed our luggage was on the SAA flight, after 30 minutes of waiting we realised that our luggage has not arrived with us. After numerous queries we managed to locate our luggage (Thanks to helpful staff at OR Tambo). As the lady at the counter said that we must actually be thankful that our luggage has arrived. The staff at Kenyan Airways was unhelpful and made as though everything was our fault. I will never fly Kenya Airways again.",Family Leisure,1.0,1.0

Heathrow to Nairobi was full, had an aisle seat, but cushion was well worn. Evening meal served by efficient cabin crew. Meal and breakfast was better than on some better known airlines. Nairobi to Dar es Salaam on Embraer 190 was a pleasant flight, comfortable leather seats and another breakfast. Flight was on time. Return flight from Dar es Salaam scheduled for 3.45 am which was a bit inconvenient, but get to the departure gate in good time - this flight left 15 minutes early as all passengers had boarded. Aircraft was clean, breakfast was served. Cabin crew efficient. At Nairobi there is a scheduled 4 hour wait for the flight to Heathrow. Again aircraft was on time and nearly full. Yet another breakfast, this time a full meal with three choices - omelette, sausage or vegetarian. Cabin crew efficient and worked smoothly and without fuss. Had an aisle seat next to the exit door, plenty of legroom and a comfortable flight. Maybe they could have done a couple of water runs as it is a long flight.

I was surprised (and a little nervous) that my connection in Nairobi was only 50 minutes - what could possibly go wrong? - but on the day, everything went like clockwork. The first flight was in an Embraer, very comfortable and even had USB ports. Nice light breakfast served. Magnificent views of Kilimanjaro on this route (left side, but I imagine this could vary). Departed and arrived on time, found my new gate relatively easily and with plenty of time to explore the severely overpriced airport food outlets.

My onboard entertainment system did not function on either the outbound or inbound flights on the London Nairobi flights. the sound accompanying films was inaudible on both the airline provided headsets and my noise cancelling headphones.

The next thing we knew we were called to ""final boarding"". Arrived at the gate to confusion. Once we were boarded the confusion continued. Lots of chatting among staff at the doors for about 20 minutes. During that time there was no attempt to serve the business class passengers. It was a long flight. No water bottles provided which is fine because we like to try and keep things environmentally friendly but also had to ask repeatedly for glasses of water. Had to help ourselves to pillows and blankets from a bin. They ran out of 2 of the 3 choices of breakfast by row 4 in business class. The USB charger in my seat didn't work. My headphones made a loud screeching noise if I turned my head. My seat wouldn't fully recline. During take off and landing our attendant kicked off her shoes and slept.

When we were checking in just now for our flight back to Guangzhou, we confirmed our destination with the staff, but they still gave us boarding passes which said from Nairobi to Bangkok. But for my asking the airline desk later when we got into the waiting area, we wouldn't even know that we still need boarding passes from Bangkok to Guangzhou and things would be even more troublesome if I hadn't asked. Never seen a via flight that requires 2 boarding passes for a person, each for a sector of the flight! When we flew from Guangzhou to Nairobi, it was only one boarding pass per person. More bizarrely, we are placed in different seats these two sectors, which means we will still have to change seats when we arrive in Bangkok! Moreover, flight service is mediocre.

At departure in Cape Town we were told they had no fragile stickers, my husband and I were put in separate seating areas, despite purchasing the tickets simultaneously, using one card. they managed to sort that out as we boarded.The plane was old and dirty too! The mistake and lack of acknowledgement is 930 AED and 20 hours wasted.

A colleague and I were booked to travel from Dakar to Nairobi and from Nairobi to Johannesburg. The point of taking this route was to get to Johannesburg before noon on Saturday 9th in order to attend to other commitments there. Kenya Airways seemed the most convenient for our requirements, there was a two hour plus gap between the scheduled arrival time of KQ513 and the departure time of KQ760 - so none of us could have imagined the nightmare that awaited us at the Kenya Airways hub in Nairobi!  Due to a 2hour 15 minute (or longer) delay of the departure of KQ513 from Dakar, we barely made it on time for our connecting flight. There was no ground staff available to assist us get to the connecting flight. The ground staff at the gate were quick to gleefully tell us that we had been off-loaded from flight KQ760 to Johannesburg.  They were there to block not to facilitate passengers. Following desperate pleas, they decided to board the business class passengers and not economy class - thus separating my colleague and I. When I pleaded on my colleague's behalf I was told that not enough meals were loaded into the economy class cabin! If passengers are late due to a Kenyan Airways delay (and no fault of their own) ground staff should meet the passengers and escort them to the connecting flight if it is still on the ground. In the event that the flight is over-booked tell passengers the truth than use an excuse as pathetic as the one that was given by ground staff. ",Business,1.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,3.0,September 2017,2.0,2.0,3.0,no,Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi,3.0," |  Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi. It is obvious why this airline is in deep financial trouble. None of the payment methods on their website work - we tried several different credit cards from different banks from accounts in different countries (including East Africa) and none of them worked. Flights need to be paid for (with an additional fee - they will not waive it even though their website has payment issues) over the phone or through third-party websites. We needed to change our business class tickets to the next day due to unforseeable changes. Although their website says you can do this online, you can't. Again, it wouldn't take any payment method even when we did a 3 way call between our banks and the airline. Their solution was to write an email to their tech department. All of the flight options the website showed were different from what the Kenya Airways representative could see on their end. All of the flight options the representative could see were hundreds of dollars more than what was being shown to us on their website. After several hours (12pm until 7pm) and dropped calls later, they finally booked us a ticket that ended up costing us significantly more and we ended up losing our business class seats. We couldn't pay over the phone and so we were told we could pay at the airport at no extra charge. Upon reaching the airport, the ticketing agent charged us even more than the price on the emailed ticked we had. She refused to call the manager and told us we could either pay the extra money or not get on the flight. Once finally reaching our destination, we tried reaching out to Kenya Airways several times to share our poor experience, hoping they would do something about it to avoid losing our business in the future as we fly into East Africa often to vist family & friends. Instead, we were met with a generic email replies telling us they were ""looking into the situation."" This airline and their customer service is a disappointment. Unfortunately they have a monopoly over the East African region, offering the only choice to fly between major cities.

The 45 min delay turned out to be over 2 hours. Cabin was untidy and dirty when joining the flight, which originated in Guangzhou, in Bangkok. The seat was spacious but lacked any privacy dividers or hoods, leaving one exposed to the frequent foot traffic walking up and down the cabin all night. Inflight catering in 'Premier World' was mediocre. No menu was handed to passengers. A cold chicken pie and some 'vegetarian' snack was offered alongside a small chocolate cake after take-off for this 8h30 overnight flight. No appetizer, no salad, no option of a warm meal, just some basic finger food. The crew had to be reminded to hand out the amenity kits which contain eyeshades, socks ear plugs, a pen and toothbrush. Cabin lights were dimmed but the crew didn't bother to close the curtains between the galley at the second door and the cabin, leaving the front section bright and uncomfortable. Landing in Nairobi was 1 hr 20 minutes behind schedule, ground staff made little effort to accommodate connecting passengers who missed their connection. Overall an underwhelming experience.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,February 2018,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Entebbe to Mumbai via Nairobi,3.0," |  Entebbe to Mumbai via Nairobi connecting on Jet Airways to Colombo. The ground staff was acting completely arbitrarily, and each of them had different rules. Our main problem with Kenya Airways was not on board, but with the ground staff. My husband (Ugandan) and I (German) were booked on a flight to Colombo in Sri Lanka. It was a one-way ticket. Since the Sri Lankan Visa is only for 30 days, I had another flight booked with Malaysian Airlines to Cambodia within that period. My husband and I both had E-Visas for Sri Lanka. So when we came to Entebbe Airport, the Kenya Airways Lady at the Check-In counter didn't let us board the airplane. She claimed, that Ugandan citizens weren't allowed to go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa (Our E-Visa was already granted and even certified by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kampala). Also, she said that we had to have a flight from Sri Lanka back to our home countries and she couldn't let us go there on a one-way ticket. When I told her about our outbound flight with Malaysian, she said that there is ""a rule, that every person has to return to their home countries within one year"", so we had to show her a ticket back to our home countries, otherwhise she wouldn't check us in. As I said, she was acting totally arbitrarily. Unbelievable. So in the end I had to book a flight for each of us back to our home countries (which I of cause cancelled immediatly once arrived in Colombo). I did it right there and then at the airport, but she still had the opinion that our E-Visas weren't ok, so we missed the flight. Then, the lady took us to the Kenya Airways office at the airport and looked for another flight for us. But since ""it was our mistake"" that we missed it, we had to pay for the change fees. She then told us to go to the Sri Lankan High Comission in Kampala the next morning and apply for the normal visa. In general this lady was very rude, when I tried to explain to her that our E-Visas were already approved etc, she told me to shut up and that she was tired of dealing with people like us. So when we went to the embassy, we talked to the ambassador personally and he was completely shocked that they wouldn't let us board the airplane, since Ugandan citizens can go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa and ours was already approved. He gave us his personal number, so that we could call im in case we would have any problems again. The next day the Check-In lady wasn't there and we had no problems to board the airplane, even though our visa was still the same and no one asked us for return tickets to our home countries. When I sent a customer complaint to the Kenya Airways Customer Service, they answered me that they received it and would forward it to someone from the Customer Service team. But after that, I didn't receive a reply for 1 month. So just recently I e-mailed them again, saying that I am still waiting for a reply, but nothing happend. I am deeply disappointed. This was my first experience with Kenya Airways, and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me in terms of flying. Never ever did I experience something like that with any other airline. I lost a lot of money and I didn't even receive an apologetic message from them, not even talking about compensation for the inconvenience. I would never recommend this airline to anyone! Don't fly with Kenya Airways if you don't want to have incidents like this, just save your time, money and energy and fly with other airlines like Qatar or Emirates.",Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0

Seamless check in service with Delta Airlines Elite Medallion Members is a excellent service Kenya Airways offers.

However,  the meals, etc were acceptable. Flight attendants were good too. While not at the standards of the Game Lodges and many restaurants in the country in terms of wait service, they were fine. The big issue with me was the seats, they were extremely uncomfortable in Economy. Even with a neck pillow, the seats were hard and cramped. This will become a challenge for passengers on their soon to start non-stop to New York, sitting 15.5 hours on these seats would not  be something I would do.

After 10 minutes another lady answered and quoted me a fare £200 higher. When I mentioned that I had been quoted a different fare just a few minutes before and wanted to speak to the guy, she said she did not know where he was. I rang first thing the following day and another lady did the booking by phone within a few minutes at a much lower fare without haggling. The issue of fax machine did not arise, and I wondered if each person on shift had their own rules.

Totally full flight London - Nairobi departed with a 90 minute delay on the tarmac whilst awaiting ATC issues. Captain welcomed us with a 'Good Morning' (at 7 p.m. this was slightly disconcerting) and gave us very limited information about the delay. Cabin crew went round with water on one side of the cabin - but not on ours. On time arrival into Entebbe and luggage out quickly (reassuring considering the delay in London making the connection tighter than it should have been). A cooked breakfast on either the early morning arrival into Nairobi or the 8 a.m. arrival into Uganda would have been really welcomed.

It is the most disappointed and frustrating journey.  According to the flight information, the aircraft should have taken off at 3:00pm in Bankkok and arrived in Guangzhou at 7:00 pm on that day. However, once we checked in, we were told that the flight was delayed without detailed reason provided. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew could confirm the exact boarding time. We had been waiting restlessly for more than 5 hours without any notice or compensation. That is unacceptable. It was until 8:25 pm that the flight took off, which was 5 hours and 25 minutes later than it was supposed to be. That ruined our trip on that day. In addition, during the flight, one of passengers sitting behind me kept asking cabin crew for alcohol, it astonished me that the cabin crew continued to offer her more alcohol. Consequently, that overly-drunk lady was  out of control, singing and laughing loudly. It annoyed all the other surrounding passengers and adversely affected the safety of the flight. I tried to summon assistance from the crew. It surprised me that the crew ignored my call for four times. I cannot tolerate such bad behaviour.

Both check-ins and boarding processes were smooth and easy - except that on the first flight some passengers were allowed to carry huge quantities of hand luggage on board, causing some chaos and frayed tempers. The seats were a little narrow. On the first flight the breakfast served was expansive, with three choices offered in economy class; the lunch on the second flight was also good. The first crew were rather brusque and unsmiling -- but this was made up for by the friendly crew on the second flight (which was much less full).

Let's start with the flight out of Johannesburg being delayed such that I missed my connection from Nairobi to Arusha at 6:30 that evening. Upon arrival I went to the Kenya airways desk to arrange the next flight to Arusha. They proposed an 11:50pm flight. This flight actually would stop in Zanzibar first, thus arriving in Arusha at 3:10 am. I was aware of that flight. I had to ask if there was an earlier flight - hen and only then did the staff say, ""There is a Precision Air flight at 10:50pm."" I replied ""and is that a direct flight"". She answered ""yes"". I then had to connect the dots for the Kenya Air staff (as obviously they are not trained to use common sense or think of their customers at all). I politely said "" and doesn't Kenya Airways run Precision Air?"" At that point the stars aligned and she asked if I would prefer that flight, well yes, I would prefer getting to my lodge 3 hours earlier as it would be the middle of night! It gets better. I needed to return a day earlier so my agent called Kenya Airways on the cost to change - the cost they quoted was more expensive than just going on Expedia and buying new tickets from Arusha to Johannesburg on Kenya Airways.

I recently spent some time volunteering in Uganda and whilst I was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly. I needed to return home a few days earlier than planned, to undergo surgery, so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival at entebbe airport, they seemed unaware of my situation despite having been informed, but did sort out some help. I also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg, which was in a cast, elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more. The check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldn’t upgrade me there but that it should be possible in Nairobi where I would change to take an 8.5hr flight to London. At the gate in Nairobi I once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so I could elevate my leg. The man on the desk said that he couldn’t do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me. He was completely unsympathetic, laughing at me and treating me as if I was just trying to get some free perks. I was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full. As a goodwill gesture he’d ‘upgraded’ me to the seats with more legroom but as I explained to him when he did so, that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on, so it was still dangling down, putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling. This seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed. However, it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty, and I was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves, enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg! At no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably, despite me explaining the issue. None of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on. Whilst I understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat, I felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this, the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passenger’s wellbeing and comfort. I will not be recommending them to others and certainly won’t be rushing back to travel with ‘the pride of Africa’ any time soon. It topped off a disappointing end to what would have been a fascinating trip, but has left a sour taste in my mouth for this particular airline.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan

When converted into a bed it's angle is 170 degrees but you can't stretch your legs fully (and I'm only 5'8) which means any position for a long period of time is uncomfortable. In flight entertainment was poor - AVOD but very limited selection of films. Lots of features seemed to be broken - whether it was the control or the individual system it was unclear.

Scone was cold and dry. Cabin Crew were good but not excellent - they were courteous and warm but very slow which was disappointing as the cabin was almost empty so they had only a few passengers to serve and it still took an age for them to respond to any request or to complete each round of the meal service.

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,2.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,As per the previous review I was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from Nairobi to Heathrow as part of a round trip. The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers. All in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence.,nan,2.0,nan

This was at midnight. 2 staff were available to book over 200 people onto new flights. They were slow rude and lied about when they were able to do. They were very slow to provide any refreshments and were not able to accommodate everyone in hotels until the flights the following day - so we had to sleep on the floor.

Even though the newer aircraft had individual entertainment system it was lacking features and mine did not work. They could not even turn it off so that I could sleep so I had this white screen glaring at me all through the night.

On return flight we were once again delayed for one hour without explanation and once again AVOD in both seats did not work. Food on return flight was less than pleasant.

I say ""unfortunately"" mainly due to the more than frequent delays without explanations without anyone responsible and without real support as to what to do. You feel totally lost in the horrible JKIA. When flights get delayed over night people are ferried to hotels in CBD instead of hotels closer to the airport. Apart from this standing joke on KQ unreliability of flights I have to say that I have always received my luggage (touch wood). In-flight entertainment is a complete joke with old movies on the system that only works half the time. Twice in business NBO-Paris I had no in-flight entertainment at all and no apologies for it. Food is not too bad. Seats are old and uncomfortable.

Seats were incredibly uncomfortable. Felt like there was no padding and my seat cushion slipped forward revealing the metal base of the seat. Very uncomfortable. Inflight service did not work. No matter how many times they rebooted it certain seats were still no-ops. Headphones were falling apart and the one pair that was not was of no use as the socket on the seat I was sitting in and the one next to me was broken.

Inflight entertainment was simply missing. I didn't think any airline would put these kind of flights on popular international routes. 2 hrs after take-off the breakfast trolley is rolling past 1 hour later flight attendant offers me a tray with bread croissant butter and juice announcing continental breakfast. Half an hour later I'm still waiting for a hot drink. In the meantime the captain is apologising about late take-off from Nairobi as if it was something to be proud of. Tea eventually comes 1 hour after 'continental breakfast'. Incidentally the temperatures in the cabin is kept glacial. This is nothing compared to lunch. After a terribly long wait to only to end up with a repeat of the earlier back and forth game of trolleys and trays partially empty trays trays with this or that missing. My salad comes with the inside of the already unsealed lid smeared with what looks like chocolate pudding? We are a long cry from the fancy looking menu proudly presented at the onset of flight.

Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service.

The return flight DAR-NBO was quite the same a rather older Embraer 190 boarding late again but we took off and arrived on time at least the cabin crew were much kinder upon arrival we found our baggage at the new arrivals terminal which I have to say is the most beautiful African terminal I've seen. With all that I have to say I had the best regional flights ever. Thumbs up to Kenya Airways short haul flights.,nan,4.0,nan

Was travelling with my infant and so they gave me a very good service at both airports - Malindi Airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Gave me a front seat so I sat very comfortably throughout the flight. In-flight was also impressive was served snacks with very cheery FA's. Got a very nice view of the Mount Kilimanjaro peak which was informed to us by the Captain. Overall I would prefer KQ as my first choice.,nan,5.0,nan

Rather mediocre service. This flight was delayed for two hours due to the fact that the passenger loader was not working. No announcements were made in the lounge. The Simba Lounge was closed to me even though I showed the Delta Club Membership. Check in at the counter was sub-par as was lining up for Immigration. Asked for water for medication I was taking three times. If you are sleeping they do not serve you nor leave the headset etc in the magazine pouch in front of you. On arrival in Amsterdam you are met with armed security personnel checking your passport.,nan,3.0,nan

Over the last few years things have been going steadily downhill and over the last few trip I have done with them they have reached new depths. The in-flight entertainment system simply does not work on the London-Nairobi flight and the aircrew are clearly aware that the system has simply died. They promised a new system and new planes are coming soon - I just hope it is soon enough to save the airline.,nan,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,2.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,3.0,I flew LHR-NBO return and was generally satisfied by the service. It's nothing special but the 777 are relatively comfortable (showing some sign of age) - the best feature in both directions was that there were plenty of spare seats so passengers were able to spread out and I found the overnight timings most convenient. I found the food and drink poor however (particularly hard to face food overstrained tea and vile juice) and the in-flight entertainment distinctly average (limited range of films poor sound quality broken in several seats). Basically it's an acceptable in-flight experience that gets you efficiently from A to B and the ground experience is much more professional/competent than many other African airlines from my experience. Staff were generally friendly (with exception of some check-in staff at NBO who were grumpy).,nan,3.0,nan

Naturally most people chose chicken so by the time the staff got to us there was only vegetarian food left. We didn't get much to drink either.

Had 3 seats all the way to CAN to myself and slept very comfortably. Business Class service in Economy. Flight attendants were responsive to calls and gave good service. Return had a problem of checked in luggage which was removed due to power banks inside. Was informed about it by a KQ staff but then due to language barrier and a lazy security guard who didn't want to walk all the way to the check in counter told me all was OK and to board.

nan,Business Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,4.0,I have flown a number of times on the Bangkok-Nairobi route and had a mixed set of experiences. Seats are good for sleeping and food is edible mostly. I approach it as super premium economy with some business perks and I am not disappointed. I rarely watch in-flight entertainment but it doesn't work sometimes - that is a fact. Don't expect too much in terms of communication if there is trouble but they have generally been okay with us. Only one serious delay in 8 years (door wouldn't close) and we were treated okay in Business (slow but sure) but the economy passengers were left at the gate all night with minimal information late refreshments and little help. Basically they were dumped because Kenya Airways only had enough staff left on duty to take care of us and they had to wait until we were shuttled off to our hotel before they got any attention.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,4.0,nan,2.0,yes,nan,3.0,Just last week I was on another Kenya Airways flight but this time the experience far from what I'd expected. The aircraft itself had only just returned to Nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it. Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate. A far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the KLM B747-400 that had flown me on the outward leg.

nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Our flight from Guangzhou to Bangkok was cancelled. This is actually not something unusual. However the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster. Initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it. We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative. However the pilot did not allow the luggage to be released from the airport until the afternoon of the next day. Due to this we almost missed the next flight. Never again!,nan,2.0,nan

The service was basic food was bad my entertainment system was old and did not work  when I asked a member of staff to look they just walked off. So 8 hours with no entertainment system the fact I had legroom helped me to relax. A man sitting next to me said their entertainment systems quite often do not work. Staff looked like they did not want to be there. On Returning from Zanzibar we were told we would have to pay $100 each for extra leg room.

If KQ management would go the extra step they would graduate into another category. However very often its the individual flight attendants that keep me booking and flying KQ. We flew Economy and Business - both with different experiences. I was about not to book KQ anymore until the new dreamliner came in. Nice aircraft - friendly crew. The inflight service needs improvement. I have had better service in Economy than in Business class at times. The inflight entertainment program and equipment did not work on previous flights (both classes) except the new planes. Would I fly KQ again? Yes but if I can fly KLM equipment I would chose KLM because it is predictable in terms of standard and quality. The new Dreamliners will only be attractive as long as KQ maintains these aircraft well and keeps them clean and the inflight entertainment works.,nan,3.0,nan

I however then had a flight from Nairobi to Uganda and this was really good the plane was very new and had working TV's with pretty new films (it was only 1 hour flight).

The airline survives on it's route network - and cheap flights. With 'code-share' flights check what airline is actually providing the flight. I am using Kenya Airways again this month.

Checked in online got a boarding pass from a self-service machine at Nairobi's low tech but charming and functional terminal. Passengers were processed through to a holding area with ample seating in time to board on time via a short walk across the tarmac to our waiting new-build 767-300 which had a pleasant Signature By Boeing” 777-style interior. Pushed close to schedule and were soon on our way. Announcements describing the service to come were clear and accurate. IFE was on a rolling loop and some channels weren't working so I read instead. Meal was very basic - curried fish with rice a bread roll a small dessert but adequate. Trays were cleared away promptly and cabin lights extinguished allowing plenty of time on the 9h25m sector for sleep. Two hours before landing another hot meal of similar proportions was served. One other bonus the crew were not too obsessed with making pax close their blinds permitting some sunlight in for the last few hours which made waking up a gradual process as blinds were raised one by one.

However on the outbound journey none of the seat-back TVs worked in the centre and right hand seats most were just dead others flickered fitfully and most annoying my screen just wouldn't turn off.

The 777-300 ER from AMS to NBO had the 3-3-3 arrangement which meant a little more room than I usually get on other airlines. The food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it. The service although not perfect was fine. The IFE is not upto Emirates quality but since I don't sit for the entire flight the movie choice was ok. The flight from NBO to MBA was on a well equipped Embraer 190 which even had its own IFE quite a novelty on a short hop flight and something I've never seen in Europe. The only fly in the ointment was NBO but that is not the airlines fault that's KAA's issue. Its a bit of a nightmare for an international arrival with a domestic transfer.

Nope - they've changed their minds on this route and tried to sting us each for $120 excess baggage. One couple paid and the rest of us refused - they finally let us on because we were holding up the check-in for everyone else. No in-flight entertainment of course but flight was actually on time which is a nice change for KQ.
