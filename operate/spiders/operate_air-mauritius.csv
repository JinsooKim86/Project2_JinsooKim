nan,Economy Class,4.0,June 2018,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,Mauritius to london,1.0," |  The attitude of the cabin crew has improved. The quality of films has improved as well but the screen is abysmal so one cannot really see the film. Or for some passengers around me, their screens were not working at all. But what is disgusting with this airline is if there are delays and communication. The communication of the on ground staff is appalling - first they do not know how to handle angry passengers, they do not know how to keep the passengers updated and the airline does not have a CRM (all complaints fileId directly with the airline will go into a black hole - not even an acknowledgement of receipt). It is an unpredictable airline - if you manage to get onboard, service is ok but if something goes wrong such as cancellations (which happen very often) or long delays, then only God can help you. The only choice we have on this route (direct flight) is British Airways and therefore, if you have the choice, it is preferable to avoid Air Mauritius.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

No update was given to know what was the way forward - especially since a connection was involved. When you call Air Mauritius, the people were rude, and could not help at all. It took 7 hours of timeless wait on the phone, without someone to even lodge a decent complaint to finally get redirect to another flight combination, with inconvenient timing. They do not even get the emails right. No compensation for the delay - no apologies for the inconvenience. No miles, no upgrade, nothing. It's as if we need to be grateful that they actually redirected us, for a ticket which we have paid for!

As a regular kestrel Flyer, I expected better treatment and better service. They are very child unfriendly.  When we landed, one of our luggage was missing. This is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour. We landed on a Sunday, and had to attend a wedding the same night. My wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage. I complained to the staff, they could not care less and said I was not entitled to anything and was sent away. No manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the Prime Minister's wife in the State lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers. I complained to their customer service, and the service I received was poor. I wrote to the CEO and their Chairman. No response at all from them. When we returned to the UK 2 weeks later, two Air Mauritius Staff were travelling. They were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of paying customers. I spoke to the cabin crew about this, and they could not care less. What they offered me is 5000 travel points, 50 Euros, and to use their lounge when I travel next which is pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them. ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Leg space under the seat in front of you is awful. There was a black box next to my feet. Arm rest was painful, food below average. Cold tea / coffee served and I had to complain.

Didn't have dinner but woke early for breakfast which was very good. The crew were friendly and smiled except for one. Looking forward to my return and looking forward to the new aircraft A350 at the end of this year.

We should have flown on a Budget airline to Mauritius for a better experience! There was an hour delayed departure out from Singapore and the aircon in the plane was not working.  After take off, my husband's entertainment system was not working and we press the call bell and no one attend to us. I have to walk to the galley to inform crew about my husband's entertainment system not working.  After informing about the unserviceable system and I doubt he did anything because they were more concerned about meal service.  Finally we get hold of another Stewardess and inform her and she said she will do it later as she was occupied.  When we receive our tray, I informed the 3rd crew again about the entertainment system and she said she will reset again and doubt that it will work. She offered a seat change but we paid for the exit row (USD50 each) to enjoy the extra legroom instead of having to move to another seat behind and be separated. There were many announcement throughout the flight duration.  First meal service was rushed and after that lights switched off within 2 hours.  Our holiday mood to Mauritius was dampened by the experience with Air Mauritius.  ",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan

As already mentioned in other reviews the IFE box is situated under the seats so severely eats into the already cramped conditions. Cabin staff were generally surly and rude.

The food was mediocre and toilets filthy. I have already complained to my travel agent (Sovereign) who to their credit managed to get a long response from Air Mauritius - sadly they didn't really pay much attention to my points and said how pleased they were that I'd been moved to a seat with more legroom (I wasn't). The staff spent the flight chatting at the back of the plane and passengers were expected to walk up to the galley and help themselves to drinks. I enjoyed the IFE - saw a few films which I enjoyed.

Neither of the entertainment screens worked - in fact one was not even attached properly to the cable which had been previously taped on by an amateur. 11 hours is a long time without music or a film. Also for some unknown reason a passenger was allowed to sit in the jumpseat seat throughout the whole journey. This was unacceptable as she was right in our vision and took up the extra leg space we had paid extra for. The flight steward apologised and gave us name of the vice president of Air Mauritius customer services. When we attempted to contact him  we were told that customer services would contact us via e mail. We are still waiting. This airline is not doing us a favour.

Sat in economy and was surprised at how tight the legroom is and I'm only 5ft 9in. That was the only real negative about the flight. IFE boxes are also under each seat which limits your ability to stretch out your legs. I'm used to BA and Virgin's economy cabins which are more spacious.

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Seats on the Heathrow to Mauritius flight were hard provided no lumbar support and very uncomfortable. Some members of staff somewhat patronising and not very helpful. Headphone did not work and the food was awful. They do not serve the small bottles of wine and we were served tiny amounts of wine in plastic glasses I felt we were treated like children. When asked for two small glasses we were very patronisingly told that we have to wait for the next trolley - which was going to be a long time after the meal. My partner and I ordered vegetarian food and were served very small portions of very unappetising food and a fruit salad with acidic and unripe fruits.

Mauritius to Heathrow staff rude and spoke over our heads literally bitching about kids playing on the floor between passenger seats. They lack manners and customer service.

Things work so well from the Durban side but I have flown DUR-MRU-HKG return and JNB-MRU-LHR and by comparison the cabin crew this time barely managed a smile unless you grovelled. I don't expect to be glared at for asking for more bread. The return leg was pretty similar as far as staff went. Clearly nicer staff get to fly the longer routes. The most severe criticism I would make is the boarding leaving Mauritius. It is unjustifiable to leave long lines of passengers waiting for over an hour with no info nor telling us to all go sit down again. They knew perfectly well that they were running a full hour late as they later came up with the excuse that the plane was running late from Rodrigues! They pay lip service to priority boarding of business class passengers. Suddenly they announced a gate change so everyone had to scramble to change gates. Kept us waiting on the tarmac for the bus.

We landed and were shipped to a hotel. The following day our plane departed Milan for Paris without telling the passengers any information. Air Mauritius had one rep in Milan airport who ignored us another rep wouldn't speak with us. Very little information given to us we had to chase Air Mauritius at all times. They pretty much just abandoned us in Milan once we got off the plane. After 4 days of little information they left us to find our own way home. I certainly wouldn't recommend using Air Mauritius.

The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further.

Economy pretty standard config and seats small but relatively comfortable. Outbound at PER not allowed to use QF lounge even though I was QP. Plane quite empty. Had to wait for 1.5 hrs for Virgin arrival from Melbourne which had 40+pax on. Even with them the flight was about 70% loading. Gave us a row of 4 to us so we were able to lay the child down for a nap. Outbound was daytime flight and quite easy - IFE very basic. Food was ok (poor entree). Not a lot of drinks (hot cabin too) and service was too quick with them wanting to get everything out the way ASAP. Toddler given an infant meal (as she was on an infant ticket) and we were not allowed to get anything else as there was no other food loaded. Return - slightly more full but this time we were given a bulkhead. Pointless with a toddler but we did have a row of 4. Word of warning the bulkhead rows the arm rests do not lift up. Overnight flight but bulkhead was near toilet which was going all night - so impossible to get sleep. Also some annoying little blue light sits right above you so its not dark either. On SSR/MRU Airport second comments from Philip Loveder below. Airport cant cope with 3 x 747 and A330 leaving at the same time. Place was packed. No chairs nowhere to sit even on the floor.

Make sure you stick on your 'do not disturb' sticker on a night flight otherwise the staff wake you for breakfast even if you're fast asleep; if you have pre-assigned seats make sure you ensure they've given you those seats at check in; pre-load your own IFE on an ipad or laptop!,nan,4.0,nan

The long haul was better but even then the seats are the most uncomfortable business class seats I have ever experienced. The strange pitch means you are always sliding down and there is some kind of hard ridge right in the middle. Horrible.

The meal choice was chicken or lamb and the crew had no idea how they were prepared or what they were served with! We only got a drink half way through the main meal.

We are a well travelled couple in our 50s and have never experienced anything like this. We were moved - but we were shunted to rear of the plane and put in a middle and window seat - despite there being several rows of empty seats (which we were told were broken).

PER to SSR must have been the first A330 built seats coming apart - big black box under seat which after reading Skytrax is the ""entertainment"" box - it did not have much in it - only one movie that was worth watching. The staff appeared so uninterested - I would suggest Air Mauritius employ some staff from a country where people want to work. On return I noted that Air Mauritius did have some staff apparently not Mauritian perhaps in an attempt to lift the service standard. Two cups of tea only in a long flight one with UHT milk and one with that chemical called ""Creamer"" so I had coffee instead of tea to hide the revolting taste. Return flight about 90% full. I really noticed the difference when I got back onto Qantas at Perth for the Sydney run. Qantas offer some entertainment - a better range of movies the sound was good had a selection of Australian music - Seekers John Williamson etc. Comparing Air Mauritius to Qantas - like chalk and cheese. Have relatives that will be making two trips back to Australia this year - first will be by Air Mauritius as they are paying the second most likely by Emirates as the company is paying.

We found the airline to be no frills and got us from A to B efficiently. My complaints are the economy class seats on the older Airbus A340-300s operating from London and Paris to Mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system I struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours. The newer Airbus A330-200s operating the Mauritius to Perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. The cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service. The food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the Parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing French breakfast but on the Perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot (vegetable substance) in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing I noticed a large majority of people did not eat it. In the end it was an ok airline and would recommend it if you are stopping over in Mauritius.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,2.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,no,nan,1.0,Recently travelled to India on an Air Mauritius flight back and fro on MK748 and MK 749 respectively. However I am very disappointed by the services offered on board. I travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. On departure on 27th December we requested a baby cot (ticket booked on 11th November 2013 - more than a month before) and on check-in same was requested again and approval obtained. However to our disappointment we did not get one on board. The reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. The infant weighs: 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. The crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. We had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. On our return (10th Jan 2014) same scenario. Despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. Instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. I and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. There was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. In fact we had more rooms than expected. When I told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. (The irony is that a cot was requested and approved at Check-in in Mumbai). We did not even get an infant meal on both trips. The service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating. I am frequent traveller on Air Mauritius and as from now I will rather use other carriers for my overseas trip be it personal or business related. A very disappointed customer.,nan,1.0,nan

Checkin was chaotic leading to long queues with not enough staff to deal with it and looking visibly unhappy too. It took about 1.5 hours to get to front of queue for checkin. We boarded late only then to sit for about an hour in swelteringly hot and airless cabin before takeoff as the auxiliary power unit was not on, probably to save the airline money as the crew were unwilling to say more than they were suffering too and encouraged me to complain to the airline. Once again, staff unhappy and unmotivated. Requests to talk to senior crew member were ignored and they only came to answer my call button to switch it off, muttering 'later' or words to that effect. No choice of breakfast offered but what came was the most unappetising on any flight I have ever had. The entertainment was very outdated - tiny screen with picture shaking so much that it was unwatchable. And also poor choice of films. On the plus side, the seats were relatively comfortable but only for normal-size passengers. On our outbound flight, the rather large gentleman behind me was in visible pain due to lack of room for his girth/legs. Not that the stewardesses offered any solutions. Luckily, I found another seat so I moved instead to give him more room. As our chosen seats when booking had been unceremoniously reallocated to others by the time we checked in (another first experience for me) this wasn't too much of a hardship.",Family Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,November 2016,2.0,1.0,2.0,no,MRU to PER,2.0," |  Mauritius to Perth. Flight to Mauritius was delayed for 2 hours. No explanation, then was cancelled with no warning. A guy from Air Mauritius came out and yelled over the top of everyone saying flight has been cancelled come back tomorrow at the same time, then just walked off like that. No one knew what was going on or what to do. Then when we returned the next day the flight was delayed a further 4 hours with the same poor service. Now on my way home flight is delayed a further 2 hours with the same appalling service. What a joke of an airline and the staff need to work on their customer service too!",Couple Leisure,2.0,nan
A319,Economy Class,5.0,November 2016,5.0,5.0,nan,yes,MRU to DUR,4.0,"Mauritius to Durban. Luckily we sat in the front row with the babies and kids. The legroom was excellent. However the legroom for the other seats I noticed was miserable. Tall passengers with their legs in the aisle. Aircraft was clean, crew very friendly and breakfast excellent on this 4 hour flight. However after 1 month I still have not been credited with my miles in my Air France account. Pretty annoying.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
A340,Economy Class,5.0,November 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,JNB to MRU,5.0,"Johannesburg to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. The nicest cabin interiors which make you feel that you are already at the beach. Very friendly staff; excellent legroom. Quite a decent meal for a 4 hour flight. Audio and entertainment worked and cabin was clean. The flight left and arrived on time. However South African Airways staff who weigh the bags for Air Mauritius were a pain, though we were only 2 kilos overweight on one bag. They blamed it on Air Mauritius though SAA flights also watch the exact weight.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan

I had the emergency slide on front of my legs. Seats are very uncomfortable. Good thing about this airline is that you get free spirits (when you ask). The main reason I have chose this flight was because it was direct.",Couple Leisure,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,July 2016,2.0,2.0,nan,no,LHR to MRU,1.0," |  London Heathrow to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. Staff was helpful and friendly. Food was very average. Entertainment was very tragic. This route uses the old style entertainment system Which plays a set number of films on loop. Inflight entertainment system was old and not flexible and the screens were unclear. Bad quality monitors and headphones, nothing was to actually see and hear. The seat were uncomfortable, very little legroom. They lost my luggage, no one knew why or where it was, we waited 5 days for luggege without any information from the Air Mauritius what happened, when we could expect it . We got 2000MUR (ca. 40 GBP) as atonement, but it was enough only for a swimsuit and shampoo. We do not recommend this airline at all.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
