Boeing 787-9,Business Class,5.0,July 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes,London to Bahrain,5.0," |  London to Bahrain. I'm a regular on the LHR-BAH route but this was the first time on the 787. A huge improvement generally compared to the A330, and that certainly wasn't bad. It's very quiet and smooth, and the new staff uniform is very smart. The seat is excellent and all-aisle access is a good move. The handheld IFE controller is a down point though,  not very intuitive how to use it. In fact, IFE generally is a miss... the screen is massive and high quality, but the film and TV selection is small, and seems to just be lifted from the A330, a big miss to upgrade this. Gulf Air food is normally very good but on this flight it wasn't great, with a dry prawn salad and a massively overcooked beef dish. However, I think this is a one off that I can forgive based on history. Little things matter, so for the first time I've seen on a GF flight, they handed out landing cards whilst en route - just made arriving a bit simpler. So overall, a big jump in the right direction, but don't waste the excellent IFE screen with poor content.",Business,4.0,nan

The meals were hot on both the outgoing and return flights, cabin crew were attentive, Nothing to complain about, nothing to overly praise either, I am not sure if they are competing with the other Arab region airlines, if they are, Gulf Air still have a little way to go.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

They now have a game changer in the shape of the Boeing 787 twice daily to London. I chose them over a UAE direct route as in the busy summer period the fare was 80% less though still considerable. Decent lounge in Bahrain, short flight in from DXB good breakfast served. London leg in the new 787 is fantastic, champagne good on the ground lounge at LHR T4 very calm and civilised. The new seat is well contained but with aisle access, gracious cabin crew, wonderful Sky chef both ways and the crew worked non stop with about 2o pax both ways. Food is served individually, delicious desserts trolley served, afternoon tea round 2, on time. AVOD is only about 60 movies, also wine lists had not been printed. Aircraft is only a month old and comfortable. ",Business,4.0,3.0

The first leg of the outward journey was fine - we boarded and departed from Heathrow on time and the crew were professional and efficient. Then we got to Bahrain and quality went out of the window. The Gulf Air ground crew were rude and insolent. Then the flight crew didn't bother to turn up on time and the flight to Dubai was delayed - no word of explanation or apology. The flight attendants seemed unable to communicate verbally. I am now on the return part of my journey and sitting in Dubai airport where (surprise surprise!) the flight to Bahrain has been delayed by 1.5 hours- once again with no explanation.

I fly Gulf Air regularly to the UK and around the gulf region so this airlines suits me fine with good routes and timings. I've found them punctual nearly all the time. The service on the ground and on board is acceptable. This was interesting for me because the return was on one of their brand new Dreamliner planes (3-3-3 economy configuration) and it was pretty comfortable. I was lucky as the plane wasn't completely full. The armrests lift up fully and so following meal service I was able to get some sleep across the three seats. Perfect.,Solo Leisure,4.0,nan

On the way back my wife’s chair didn’t recline and again the same nonsense! Not to mention that Gulf cancelled my connecting flight from Dubai to Bahrain but chose not to rebook it. I found this out when I then tried to call and double check all my details. I made a formal complaint to Gulf air who took 2 months to respond, they accused me of lying.

The 8 front seats on the A330 although well worn are comfortablek. With the help of the stewardess managed to lay flat during the night flight but took care not to touch anything until breakfast. The maintenance is obviously poor as I was not the only one with this problem. IFE is not to today's standard (limited choice of films and language and you have to wait for the film to begin without knowing when it will). Breakfast good but the meal on the in-flight was definitely not first class and wines were lower range. Crew in this cabin was nice both ways. No bar open between services. All in all not what you expect from 1st class.,nan,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,CAI-BAH-DXB in Y class. Check in at CAI was smooth. Cabin crew seemed generic and left no impression despite a relatively light load. A340 is by now unbearable and I do recommend against flying GF on their A340s. Wonky IFE bad seats shabby interior make for a really bad experience. Catering was quite poor - the main was alright but salad/desert were terrible. No bread or butter to be seen. Cabin did not give each passengers their own soda can which I find disappointing considering the amount of money a ticket costs. Transfer in BAH was smooth and efficient and I would rate the transfer experience ahead of DXB AUH and even DOH. More seating space in BAH than there was a few years ago. Second leg was an A330-200 better interior snack box more worthwhile and friendlier crew. GF really does need to re-motivate its employees and get rid of those A340s. I find QR to be the better airline although it isn't quite value-for-money as GF is.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,BKK-BAH-DOH-BAH-BKK. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown on. I appreciate the A340's are old but there is no excuse for not having hand soap in the toilets or having a faucet that is covered with masking tape so the water flows smoothly - left side toilets in front of seat row 33. There is zero cleaning taking place during the flight and the staff sat at the back and talked throughout the flight without offering service or maintaining the cleanliness of the plane. Paper was heaped on the floor in the toilets and there was limited water. Although staff are pleasant they do not seem happy - god knows how they are not embarrassed to work with such a poor quality airline. There also did not seem enough staff on the plane - during the safety presentation we only had one person in our cabin to do the usual safety seatbelts exits lifejacket routine. My headphone jack did not work on the way back and on the way out it was like being in the 1980's with the poor IFE. Thankfully the plane was not full so I had a whole row to myself to sleep. Its hardly surprising the plane was not full - it was one of the most disgusting plane-rides I have taken - definitely not a three-star airline. At Bahrain airport we were delayed one hour on the BHR-BKK trip and the gate was changed from 35 to 32 during the middle of loading.,nan,1.0,nan

The seats are similar to Air France economy ones (in other words okay for very small people) - on the way in there was IFE my headset was not working the replacement neither and I had to use my own. On the return one we were on 1st row had more legroom but had to do without IFE at all! Crew does the basics of the job and service acceptable. Food acceptable for economy.

Gulf Air A340-300 on KUL-BAH flights are dragging them down in their star ranking compared to the more spacious A330-200 on their BAH- CDG flights. The lack of legroom is so obvious between the two aircraft and it amazes me at the inconsistency of their products.

Flight not busy and crew friendly and upbeat snack box served. No IFE newspapers and magazines were offered. 4 hour connection time in Bahrain used Gulf Air business lounge which despite showing signs of wear still offers good service cold and hot snacks and free wifi. BAH-LHR on A330 got 3 seats by window to myself - not very comfortable for sleeping but better than trying to sleep upright! Plenty of pillows and blankets offered. Crew polite and efficient and food was fine. In flight entertainment not AVOD offered a decent selection. Cleared LHR immigration with IRIS which is great however there was no priority baggage handling. LHR-BAH : now that Gulf Air uses T4 they no longer have their own lounge- they now share with Skyteam. T4 is pretty gloomy at night and most concessions were closed. On plus side security was faster to clear than at T3. A340 left on time crew efficient and minimally polite. Food and comfort decent and early arrival ahead of schedule into Bahrain. Was able to standby for an earlier flight that day. BAH-KWI on A319 busy flight crew were pleasant and courteous. Snack box served. Considering this is economy class not a bad experience and very good value considering the fare I paid.,nan,4.0,nan

nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,KUL-BAH-LHR and back - flights not as bad as I expected it to be. Flight from KUL on an ancient A340 which featured peep holes between two toilets at the back of the aircraft (ex- SQ). Flight was packed and seats carpets and other parts of the overhead cabin were falling apart. BAH to LHR was on a similar aircraft but a shade better. Crew generally pleasant and made up for the shabby aircraft. Transit in BAH is tedious with the security checks even upon arrival before proceeding to transfer desk with no consideration to short transits. Return on LHR to BAH was stated A332 but my worst enemy appeared the A340 - same aircraft then took me to KUL eventually. Crew again very pleasant and friendly food alright but Gulf Air needs to really buck up on their aircraft renewal refurbishing or upgrading at least. They have so much to offer otherwise.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Business Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,nan,Larnaca-Dubai via Bahrain Business class. Gulf Air offers cheap rates compared to with Emirates. The day of departure they suffered a London Heathrow T5 problem with their computer system so my flight was delayed and I had to wait 6 hours in Bahrain for a connecting flight to Dubai. Gulf Air was very good in communicating the delays via SMS. All flights are old style business class but much better than European short or medium haul business class. Service and food was excellent Larnaca to Bahrain average on other flights. Good wine selection. Business Lounge in Bahrain is excellent but I pity the economy passengers who must transit in such poor airport. No security fast track at Bahrain but the security staff is very prompt in screening passenger (not sure that they are very thorough in their safety check though).,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,no,nan,nan,Paris CDG to Bahrein and back in Economy. On the flight to BAH (daytime) I found that the hot meal was not good (tasteless) and IFE is really outdated with a very limited choice and no information regarding the hours when the film begins. Not confortable but what you expect from Economy. On the way back (at a terrible time 1.30 am) the weaknesses of the old planes are even more obvious. The economy seat seems to have no more foam left on the back mine could not recline the IFE of my colleague was broken (we were on a front seat so it was the folding type) and would not held in position. I was unable to sleep at all but those who were had the pleasure of being waken up by the crew 2.25 hours before landing to serve breakfast!

Bahrain to London (on ancient A340-300) was a nightmare as there were infants & kids crying all night. It was such a pain having to tolerate the endless wailing for the duration of the flight on an aircraft that has served its shelf life. Gulf Air seriously needs to upgrade their hardware to complement the effort their cabin crew contribute.

From a premium cabin point of view Gulf Air has three main problems - its aircraft crew and its catering all range from top notch to very poor. DXB-BAH an old looking A340 featuring an equally old and completely outdated interior - legroom in the former First Class seats in row 1/ 2 seemed quite spacious legroom in the four rows that used to be Business Class is very poor. This is Business Class the way it used to be 15 or 20 years ago. On the 55 min flight to Bahrain a small warm meal was served with beverages. The crew was professional and friendly service. In Bahrain I spent some time enjoying the Business class lounge where plenty of food and Champagne was available. BAH-BKK to Bangkok I had seat 1F in a seat I knew from when it used to be First Class. A330s of Gulf Air feature excellent premium cabins although there are always technical problems with the seats. Seats in row 1 and 2 with plenty of space and privacy. Friendly and professional service was provided by flight attendants. A full dinner service provided with continental breakfast before landing. Meal is nicely set up with no use of trays but food presentation and taste could be improved. While plenty of drinks are provided it would be nice if wine was poured from the bottle in the cabin rather than in the galley. Gulf Air claims that sleeper suits are provided but none appeared on this flight.

The flight was a little late leaving but its rare to depart exactly on time. The plane was old and dirty and seats not very comfortable. I am a very tall guy so I must have extra leg room which they were more than happy to arrange - but there were plenty of spare seats so if your on the ball you can grab a whole row and lay across I was not so lucky the seats were quite narrow too. The food was terrible I couldn't eat half of it as its catered for middle-eastern people. Their prices are good and it shows - if you don't care about food and cleanliness then its fine but I wouldn't fly with them again if I had the choice. The staff were friendly but you rarely see them only to give you food and you don't get any free drinks only with a meal.

Previously was around 6-700 Dinars return Bahrain-Bangkok. Now it is running 650 Dinars one way! More than 1400 Dinars return. I checked Bahrain to London and it is running 750 Dinars - one way. I thought it might be due to upgrading costs for the Falcon Gold cabin but they are pricing themselves out of the game and still using the same tired A340s maybe spruced up a bit but I don't know as I'm now avoiding Gulf and their price gouging like the plague. Qatar Airways Business class is still reasonable around 6-700 Dinars return if you don't mind the short turn around in Doha between Bahrain and Bangkok. My mate did it last week and said it was good.

IFE is AVOD but with limited choice of viewing. GF makes a big thing of having a chef onboard but in reality the food is standard medium haul Business fare that is reasonably presented but questionable quality. I had lamb steak which was inedible – a sharp knife was not able to cut through the steak. The cabin crew was multi-national as is normal in the Middle East – efficient and professional if not full of the joys of life. This was a 09h40 departure out of BAH supposedly but initially delayed to 10h45 due to the usual ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. At 10h45 when on-board we were advised that we would be further delayed until 11h15 whilst we awaited some connecting passengers who had been delayed due to their ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. Then we were told that a passenger had fallen ill and that we had to await the arrival of a doctor who eventually pitched up and treated the passenger on-board. That whole process took almost another hour – he was very lucky as most other airlines would have booted the passenger off. We eventually got away at 12h15 2h 35m late.

Just after midnight transferred back to the airport for 2am flight to Kuala Lumpur. The flight ended up to be 95% full and it was extremely painful to sit on the hard Y seats of their A330-200. Service and meal great. I just wonder why the 2nd meal service for all flight ex-Bahrain is much more appetizing as compared to those flight bound for Bahrain?,nan,4.0,nan

We wrote complaint to Gulf Air but we don't get any answer on that. It seems that Gulf Air is not interested. Kathmandu to Bahrein was not pleasant customers were about 98 percent Nepalese and crew was not polite or helpful.

Noisy plane 75% full but still nice caring service. Good food 3 options again. I rejected the red wine and the FA brought me a glass of a much better wine from the Business Class section.

The food on the first flight was excellent and seats were comfortable. Only negative points : the plane was very cold when we boarded it and that didn't improve much during the flight (fortunately they handed out blankets generously) and the IFE system for my seat was not working properly.

On the flight from Kabul to BAH the Arabic lamb stew and tabuleh salad were nothing short of excellent and the full open bar service is generous as nearly unlimited rounds are offered. Transiting BAH is very easy and GF's arrangement with Aeroports de Paris is such that it is assigned gates at CDG that are immediately adjacent to its code-share partner AA so that transit experience is seamless as well.

On check-in I'd been warned that refurb work at BAH meant they were using a temporary lounge. They were using the quite basic Cathay lounge instead which was crowded and poor.

The plane from Bangkok to Bahrain seemed to be old with poor maintenance seats rows close and the seats have a poor reclining angle.

Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast.

I had an aisle seat - 22c and was struck painfully on the knee by a trolley woken frequently by having my shoulder knocked by stewardesses water tipped on me from a food tray being passed over no apology or explanation.

However our booking experience was horrendous. In October we booked a flight to Sri Lanka for 3 weeks returning on an evening flight (7pm) from Colombo on 22 Dec. On 3 Dec our agent advised us of a change to our return flight which would involve us arriving in Bahrain at 07.40 on 23 Jan and leaving there on 24 Jan at 02.00 - no offer of hotel. After protest this was changed to another flight leaving Colombo at 04.45 on 22 Jan. This meant we would lose a day of our holiday. After another protest this was changed (on 6 Dec) to the same time but on 24 Jan now 2 days more than planned. Finally on 3 Jan we received yet another email changing our return flight offering us to either return on 22 (as previously suggested) in the early morning flight or on 25 on the same flight. We now had a choice of losing 2 days or gaining 2 days and had no time to reply as taxi was waiting (and hotels etc were already booked). We had to sort this out at Heathrow where they were very helpful and we finally agreed to return on 25 Jan 3 days later than the original plan. All these changes were attributed to cancellations by Gulf Air. We frequently tried to contact them by phone but without success. We thought at first it was an excuse from our agent but have since discovered that Gulf Air had cancelled several flights the previous month. I shall certainly never fly with them again.

What it lacks in new aircraft super IFE and gadgets and gizmos is more than compensated for by the crew who give excellent customer service. All cabins lightly loaded in all sectors. I managed to get row 8 on the two longer flights and had no one sitting next to me. Therefore masses of leg and elbow room. Onboard chef a nice touch. Could not fault the catering. If I had to grumble about anything it's possibly the slow service on the Bahrain to London sector where the same crew start serving at Row 1. So it took a while to reach Row 8. Not to worry: a flight attendant kept my glass of Laurent Perrier champagne filled up throughout and replenished the bowl of hot nuts several times without the need to be prompted.

After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little concerned however I must say I was very pleased with Gulf Air. We departed late from Heathrow not because of Gulf Air but the usual Heathrow being busy scenario and this meant we would be arrived in Bahrain with a very short connection time of about one hour. The A330 'KC' had been refitted with the new interior which made the cabin smart bright and airy. Seat was comfortable for the six and a half hour journey and I was only just starting to get restless as we arrived. I'm over 6' tall by the way! Cabin crew were very friendly but don't expect much in the way of offerings onboard. We got a drink just after leaving Heathrow then the next offering was two hours later and that was lunch. The food was rather good and I cleared everything! After Lunch the next your get will be just before arrival and that's just orange juice or water. I was starving by the time we arrived in Bahrain but because of the short connection time and arriving late didn't have time to buy anything so next time I would board with supplies. Note that in arrival in Bahrain it will be a bus from the aircraft to the terminal as they park the aircraft up overnight away from the terminal and you'll have to get through another security check too so don't hang about! Bags had been checked through from London so we had everything crossed that they would make it to Muscat too. Flight from BAH-MCT was hassle free the seats actually had more leg room than the flight from London weird! It's only about an hour and a half so comfort not an issue. The aircraft look nearly new so are clean and bright inside and out. You get a cold snack too which was tasty. Crew friendly and both legs and believe it or not our bags arrived too.

nan,Economy Class,3.0,nan,3.0,nan,3.0,yes,nan,2.0,Mediocre at best. I live in the Middle East in Oman. The national carrier Oman Air is consistently ranked among the best and its product is very good when compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. Unfortunately however that ranking seems to have gone to Oman Air's head lately and they have not only increased prices dramatically but are apparently also considering cutting a lot of the services and features that have made them a stand out in a field of also-rans. Because they are above what I can afford for last minute leisure trips I chose to fly Gulf Air to London on the routing MCT-BAH-LHR early this month. The pricing is very competitive and their website originally showed me a wonderful pair of flights that would have only meant a short layover of under two hours in Bahrain. Once the payment screen had been completed however I received ticketing on two flight sets that incorporated a 9.5 hour layover in Bahrain on the way to London and a 7.5 hour layover on the return trip. Amazingly while I was lured in with such a terrific original offer I was now going to be spending nearly one day of my break in Bahrain's mediocre International Airport (and in that facility's mediocre Dilmun Lounge - see separate review). At Muscat we were delayed in boarding and is usual with many Middle Eastern airlines no reason was given for the delay - it just was. Boarding the A320 for Bahrain legroom was quite adequate at 34 inches of pitch I had experienced this on previous short-haul flights with Gulf Air and therefore thought they might be just the ticket to avoid rival Oman Air's new inflationary price structure. After landing at Bahrain International and a lengthy stay in the wildly overpriced Dilmun Lounge I boarded the leg for LHR and was amazed that on an A330 any airline would tighten the seat pith to a measly 31 inches which made for a 7 hour torture ride. Luckily on that leg I had a short row (two seats) to myself and was able to mitigate the pain a little. Sadly Gulf Air has revamped its A330s with new leather seats from Recaro arguably the worst airline seat maker out there. Each of their seats on any aircraft features rough Philips-head screws at precisely where my knees are forced to contact the seat in front of me as I am rather tall and have long legs - sheer torture. If the person in front of me then reclines things are beyond the pale of bearable. Again the flight was delayed and of course there was no explanation of any kind. Gulf Air needs to pull up its socks in terms of food service. While the food was excellent there was precious little of it - only one meal service barely two beverage services and nothing more on an intercontinental price. No comfort packet with eye masks no direly needed ear plugs nothing more. Basically the return trip was the same in reverse although push-back from Heathrow was on the dot. Will I fly Gulf Air again? Probably yes but I'll try to limit it to short haul which is their vastly superior product.,nan,4.0,nan

The aircraft was clean which you'd expect on a newly retrofitted aircraft. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The food was actually very nice but lacking in options. Being a red-eye flight there was at least 70% of the seats empty so I got some decent shut eye! The A320 from BAH to DXB was as full capacity as you'd expect for a regional flight.

Today what's left of its long haul business relies on six ageing and by all accounts increasingly unreliable A330s. The slightest unscheduled disruption can, and does, lead to service meltdown. Although we were forewarned by Gulf there'd be problems at Bahrain - a quick check on flight tracking websites suggested at least two A330s had been taken out of service - this did not prepare us for the chaotic scenes on arrival with all long haul flights either cancelled or operating many hours if not days behind schedule. Good point: Gulf Air had done the honourable and organised 5* hotel accommodation and food for the day in Bahrain. Bad point: they neglected to tell us prior to arrival; we only found out by word of mouth after wasting the best part of an hour in various queues. Once we eventually departed the flight was satisfactory; food and service good, legroom tight but no worse than others in cattle class, an excellent inflight system with, alas, nothing much to watch.

This means that at the very start of a long day you start sweating, your clothes become drenched in perspiration and by the end of the day you feel really uncomfortable. They do this so regularly now that it is not an accident. None of the other airlines do it and I'm guessing they think they are being cute and saving money.

However, due to poor weather conditions my flights (Bangkok to Bahrain and then to London) were all affected and dealt with with such a poor quality. I would have expected a much more organisation in Bahrain. When I came for my finally rescheduled flight after being redirected to land in Doha and having waited at the airport for 12 hours with the lack of airline staff and updates - no information was given only that we need to sit and wait at gate c13. Hours passed and we had to ourselves go and look all around the airport for any staff until when we found it to get no information. In Bahrain, I had my second leg rescheduled and when I arrived at the airport, that was delayed as well. In the airport there was no such flight on the screen. No crew members or customer service for economy passengers from the airline even though the airline is the airline of Bahrain. How is that? Sleeping at the airport for another 6 hours, with no information - on the board it says the flight has been rescheduled to 2.50, then for 5.20 but the time is already 6 in the morning. Then it has been changed to 5.20, after which no new information is given, and everyone is waiting with no crew member to come and explain or even give any information through the speakers. I do understand it is the weather which is out of control of the airline, but there should be organised crew to accommodate all the passengers for such unexpected events. At least someone to come and give us updates at least once an hour. Not leaving passengers with no signs of guidance for many hours of stress. Food is good. Air crew is exceptional. Ground crew is of unacceptable quality. I have been left with unpleasant feelings about the airline only from the way they have dealt with this situation and being under so much stress while looking for answers and being provided with no clear options of being offered accommodation or some other comfort while waiting for 12 hours in Doha.

Overall the experience was good but there are some definite areas where Gulf Air could easily enhance the passenger experience. I booked my flights on the Gulf Air website, the booking and seat selection process was generally easy however the website would not accept my American Airlines frequent flyer number (I think because it is alpha-numeric). I checked in using the mobile version of the Gulf Air website, this was also easy to use but there were some more minor issues; the AAdvantage number was accepted but the system didn't like my passport number (again this seemed to be because it is alpha-numeric). Fast track security at Heathrow was efficient and the Gulf Air T4 lounge was spacious, had good views of the ramp and a good selection of complimentary food and beverage items. The boarding process was efficient and there was a warm welcome from the Cabin Manager at the boarding door. Prior to departure passengers were offered a welcome drink as well as arabic coffee and dates. The cabin is configured 2x2x2 with seats upholstered in leather. I found the seat comfortable in a seated and reclined position but not so much in the sleeping position due to being sloped. Upon boarding however I noticed a dirty tissue in the side compartment of my seat (presumably missed by the cleaners) and attention to detail with cabin cleanliness seemed to be lacking. The crew were profusely apologetic about this. The onboard service from the Cabin Crew was warm, attentive and friendly and catering was of a high standard. The crew regularly offered drink refills and had a good presence in the cabin. Unfortunately I was served one drink in a dirty glass and again the crew were very apologetic. The transfer to my connecting flight in BAH was easy and the lounge in BAH was of a similar standard to the LHR lounge. Strangely the gate agent for the BAH-AUH sector had to hand write boarding passes for any passengers (including me) who presented mobile boarding passes. This created a delay at the gate and seems to defeat the purpose of a mobile boarding pass if the staff literally have to write one out by hand (something I have never seen before). The short hop to AUH on was an A320ER with the same seats as found on the A330 but in a 2x2 configuration, very nice for such a short sector.",Business,4.0,2.0

Comparing longhaul economy class of Gulf Air with economy class of established airlines, Gulf Air can compete with those in terms of comfort and food. The only real letdown is the entertainment system. There  is an IFE system installed but there should be a lot more variety. Nevertheless in my personal opinion seating comfort is worth more than having 200 movies available. The cabin on the A330s seems to be newly refurbished. Legroom on their A330s is as far as I can say bigger than on other airlines A330s. Bonus is the comfort on their A320s which they are using from BAH to FRA. Due to the fact that they are operating the A320 on its max range I guess the number of pax is limited. As a result those A320s seem to be kind of modified longhaul A320s with only a small number of seats in longhaul configuration. Therefore legroom is really good and the atmosphere is not as crowded as it is on other wide body economy flights.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan

I mentioned this and showed the message to GF check-in but they insisted that the flight was not delayed and issued my boarding passes. I refused and asked them to wait as I was not keen to travel to BAH on a delayed flight and find my connecting one to BKK departed from there. The check in staff was adamant and almost impolite. A few minutes wait later they admitted there was a delay and I would thereby miss my connection from BAH. I asked to be endorsed on another airline as I had a day full of work meetings the following day. After a great deal of time, they offered me a seat on another airline on economy class without any compensation!  The check in staff completely disinterested and said this was the final offer and there was no Gulf Air representative available. He showed little interest in my plight and went around walking and chatting with his team members. He advised that a Gulf Air representative will be there in 20 minutes. Finally after 35 minutes Gulf Air's staff arrived and repeated the same offer. He told me that I could fly to BAH on the delayed flight and would be accommodated in a hotel there until the following nights flight to BKK. This was unacceptable as it meant I lose an entire day of work and am lodged in BAH for a whole day for no reason. He asked me to take it or leave it as this was the only offer. To me this was unacceptable to be downgraded to Economy with no compensation. He told me that I was free to purchase a new ticket on another airline of my choice but Gulf Air will not compensate me.  Gulf Air let me down yesterday with its delay and made it worse by showing its Falcon Gold customer no respect or attention they deserve.

Given it cost me less than an economy ticket on one of the other gulf-based airlines, I treated myself to an upgrade for the return home. After the travails of the outward flight, I feared the worse particularly when the dreaded Gulf Air 'bad news SMS' arrived the evening before. The flight would be late, but only by an hour or so. Not a problem; the transit at Bahrain was over two hours. No queue at check-in, as to be expected, and fast-tracked through immigration and security which can be a mare at BKK. The general lounge used by Gulf was perfectly serviceable with an adequate selection of food and beverages. On joining the plane, I was greeted by a friendly crew who were attentive throughout; so happens the steward / chef was Scottish. Food was tasty albeit limited in choice compared to other operators. Likewise the vanity kit was basic. There again, why do you need anything flash? You only have to pay for it! As on the outward flight the IFR was technically excellent, not least the headphones, but woefully lacking in content. If there was any wifi, it wasn't promoted. However, you fly business class for the seat not the goodies. And this offered excellent space - six across - and comfort, and relatively new by the looks of things. Although traditional in design - it was just a seat, as is my personal preference - I had no sense of my immediate neighbours' presence. As initially advised by Gulf, the flight arrived in Bahrain an hour late. Annoyingly, although it is the norm in this part of the world, we were forced onto a bus to the terminal for no obvious reason. After a short spell in the Falcon lounge, which is excellent, eventual arrival in Abu Dhabi was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. In summary, a pleasant flight. Not up to Emirates or Qatar Airways standards, true. But if you're not able or prepared to pay the prices of these other, Gulf Air offers a highly satisfactory alternative if - and it's a very big if - its ageing planes stay healthy.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan

Aircraft cabin was clean as well as the lavatories. The food was ok, but cutlery was made of some sort of sturdy plastic and not stainless steel. In-flight service was pretty good - staff were extremely helpful and polite.

The leg room was fine on both flights and seats were comfy. The 2 hours BAH transit was smooth. On the leg from BAH to BEY, an older A320 but still clean. We got a full lunch on 9:30 which is weird but so fine and yummy (chicken pasta), their food is better than Emirates food I had previously. The IFE is outdated and limited, and thats my only complaint (playing an ad for an exhibit in March 2017 and we are in September 2017!), but fine. I recommend them and will fly them again.

Only negative on the outbound was someone having a severe attack of flatulence for most of the flight. Not the airlines fault and the flight attendants did bring some air freshener for the people in the row in front of me. The culprit remained unidentified!

Over to the customer service another agent taps the keyboard for 3 mins and then informs me to ""come back at 2100 hrs"". I ask him the reason, he says flight is overbooked and though I have a confirmed ticket nothing can be done. The customer service agent then goes inside the office for further consultation and I see his supervisor shruggging his shoulders and dismissing the customer service agent. I demand for the boarding pass to be issued. I am then confronted by the Supervisor in the customer service asking me to vacate the area. I hold my stance and insist for the release of boarding pass. Then I am directed to another agent in the customer service who offers me Business Class for a whopping BD 150 extra, and thus my travel could be ensured.

The outward got off to a bad start when we realised at Heathrow check in that our connecting flight In Bahrain for Dubai was impossible to make due to schedule changes - we had a real battle on our hands to get it changed by Gulf Air - they wanted us to sort it in Bahrain. So on leg 1, we had already lost 4 hours of our holiday. The staff were rude, plane was old and very dirty, particularly the toilets, absolutely vile. Bahrain airport is really third world. On our return journey,was even worse! Dubai Check in goes well. We wait in departure, we board and within 15 mins of being on board we are offloaded due to fog in Bahrain. We return to lounges and for the next 8 hours zero communication, terrible customer service in the first class lounge, we discover via the internet  that our flight is leaving at 7.10am. The board was never updated and apparently over 40 passengers were left behind in Dubai. We are told that our connection to London will depart at 10.10am. Arrive in Bahrain, with 90 mins to wait, and now things turn even worse. Our plane just doesn’t materialise. The staff are incredibly rude, arrogant and unhelpful. Passengers are so exhausted and frustrated, the atmosphere becomes militant and staff pull rank by threatening to call the police. In fact we were all diverted to a dead end desk area - which was just a ruse to make us feel something was happening. There was zero communication,a lot of disinterested shoulder shrugging. I can’t even be bothered to go into the exact lowdown on what transpired but eventually a plane arrives, and 3 hours later which in fact on top of Dubai delay is a grand total of 10.5 hour delay we take off.

A330-200 & A321,Economy Class,4.0,December 2017,4.0,4.0,2.0,yes,London Heathrow to Chennai via Bahrain,4.0," | Have largely positive things to say from London Heathrow - Bahrain - Chennai return trip over Christmas. All flights were roughly on time and very comfortable overall. Seats on both legs were fine and it should be noted that the A321 has an extra inch or so of legroom and better padding over the A330. Service from FAs was fine, with most of them making an effort to fulfil passengers' requests, serving a meal and a small snack on both flights of decent quality- I found myself finishing them all so they must have been ok and the offering was different on all 4 flights so good variety. Selection of drinks was small, basically just offering 2 juices and 2 soft drinks (some of which ran out in flight). Seat back entertainment was only average - the screens themselves were good quality but selections of movies, tv shows and music was small (probably around 10 western films available). Bahrain airport is small though largely clean and easy to navigate, with a small number of dining options and a fair amount of seating (none of which enables you to lie down if you have a long layover) so it was fine overall, as long as you don't mind folk washing their feet in the sink in the toilets, which seemed common! We were fortunate in that both legs between Bahrain and Chennai were far from full so once boarding was complete we managed to grab a whole row of 3 seats each to ourselves, meaning we had plenty of space to lie down in flight, though it's worth noting that none of the armrests on the A321 raise fully so you have to push them up half way and contort your body to fit. My impression of Gulf was that they'll do the job mostly well, though with no frills at all and every so often cracks appearing in the quality e.g. tissue holders coming loose in bathrooms and FAs slow to replace empty loo rolls and most worryingly on 2 flights when passengers stood up as soon as we'd landed but still taxiing and they started opening luggage compartments and moving down the aisle, FAs did practically nothing to stop them! On arrival at Heathrow we taxied for approx 10 mins with 30-40 people standing in the aisles, luggage compartments open, the plane braking heavily several times and the FAs simply asked a couple of people very quietly to sit down, when they didn't, the response was to give up! I would fly with them again if the price were right again, my wife and I paid £440 &amp, £650 respectively for flights at slightly different times around Christmas and overall this saved us several hundred pounds over other airlines.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
A330,Business Class,5.0,November 2017,4.0,5.0,1.0,yes,Bangkok to Bahrain,4.0, | Flew Bangkok to Bahrain. Gulf Air uses the Miracle lounge at Bangkok Airport. Although shared with other airlines it was almost empty. Reasonable selection of food and drink although WiFi was sluggish. Boarding was disorganised with everyone crowding the exit door making it almost impossible to get through they called business. Why can’t airlines get this right? Business was half empty and although the seats were conventional 2-2-2 they did go flat. There was no shortage of cabin crew and my glass of champagne was constantly topped up. Although it wasn’t a new aircraft it was clean and well maintained and – with a little cajoling – my seat worked as it should. The food was excellent – a decent choice and tasty with a reasonable selection of wine and other drinks. The IFE took several attempts to boot but when it did there were no movies – only TV programmes. I wasn’t too bothered because I had a good book and some work. Cabin crew seemed aware of the lack of movies. We arrived 30 minutes early at Bahrain and a coach seamlessly took the business passengers to the terminal. There was no fast track for business transfer passengers and so we had to wait for vast numbers of Indian workers to remove their belts and jewellery. But even then it was considerable more efficient than Heathrow. Gulf Air is clearly not up to Emirates/Etihad/Qatar standards but the standard of service from the friendly and chatty cabin crew and the quality of the food more than makes up for the older aircraft.,Business,5.0,nan

IFE was included but since its a short flight, you won't really have time to watch it except for a 30 minute TV show. We had a 2 hour layover in Bahrain. Dubai to London was also good, we boarded a 17-18 year old A330, but the cabin was in good condition. They gave us 1 meal, an option of chicken, beef or fish I think.

The business lounge at Bahrain is spacious and comfortable with fast Wi-Fi and numerous power points. Gulf Air has also added USB charging points adjacent to many of the tables. There was an excellent food selection and champagne at a self-service bar. Boarding was quick and efficient and the cabin crew were quick to help passengers with their bags in the half-empty business section. With advice from the on-board chef we made a food selection before taking off. There was an impressive choice and it was neatly served, very tasty and care was taken to ensure that glasses, in my case containing wine, were kept full. The seat was comfortable and the cabin, although very dry, was kept as an ideal temperature for a comfortable sleep. I opted not to receive breakfast but, from what I saw, it was equally satisfying. The cabin crew went out of their way to ensure that we were looked after and there was relatively little that I could find fault with the aircraft or the level of service. There were, perhaps, slightly too many announcements which made watching a film slightly annoying. There was a reasonable selection of films and the IFE worked seamlessly although some passengers seem slightly confused about the innovative control unit. The aircraft arrived at Bangkok Airport exactly on time and although the gate could perhaps have been slightly closer it was a quick exit and bags were arriving on the carousel is the first passengers exited immigration.",Business,5.0,nan

I have not flown with Gulf Air for several years but this flight could not be faulted – especially given the price and the not-so-modern seats. Check-in was faultless and quick. Heathrow ‘fast track’ was, for once, fast although that was probably because I was the only person passing through at that time. The Falcon lounge was perfect. Good view, easy wifi connection, power points, attentive staff, good selection of food and close to the gate. Boarding was quick and efficient with business passengers given priority. Although the seats were not flat-bed I actually prefer them for day flights – made even better because the business section was only one-thirds full. Champagne was offered on boarding and the glass was refiled. There was a delay of 30 minutes before we took off but we landed in BAH on time. There was a selection of wines including Petit Chablis: not sure why Gulf Air could not afford to spend a little extra and give of Chablis proper. Cabin crew were excellent – efficient, humorous and attentive. There was a good selection of food and drink and it was served perfectly. It was tasty and well presented. Breakfast consisted of a nice chicken salad and a delicious prawn curry. Cabin announcements were kept to a minimum which is always a relief. The selection of films was limited but more than sufficient. I managed to watch two recent films. Overall, there was nothing I could find wrong about this flight and would not hesitate to fly Gulf Air again.",Business,5.0,nan

The Falcon Gold lounge at LHR is really good and worth a visit although it can be crowded when there is a full business class. Boarding was quick and gate staff ensured that business class and families with small children could board first. The cabin crew gave a warm greeting at the door and pointed us to our seat where bottled water and aminty kits were waiting. Welcome drinks were served and the onboard chef came round to take meal orders. The seat is very comfortable and much better than say BA's but it has been a few years since GF introduced their current cabin and it is starting to show it age so while everything works the cabin is screaming for a refurbishment. The crew were a delight on this trip. We hit a spot of medium turbulence and a lady were struggling to cope but the cabin crew took turns to sit with her and reassure her for the 15 minutes or so the turbulence lasted. The food was delicius, possibly some of the best in the air and it can easily compete with Turkish and Qatar. The IFE is fairly simple and along with the cabin could benefit from attention. The stop over in BAH was made comfortable by the Falcon Gold lounge which provides great food and drink and showers if needed. The second leg to BKK was as comfortable as the first with great food and a delightful cabin crew. Again everything worked but the cabin was showing its age. That should not, however, take away the fact that GF is offering a solid business class product with one of the widest business class seats I know of making it possible to sleep comfortably. Bedding composes of a thick blanket and a pillow but there is no seat cover or turn down service provided. Unfortunately they do also not provide slippers.

Boarding was smooth, and I was offered pre flight drinks, including champagne. I opted for my favourite lemon and mint soft drink. Amenity Kit was tucked into the side of my seat. Then followed the  towel. The seat was extremely comfortable, although I found manipulating the controls little difficult. The announcements were also unclear. Pre-dinner drinks were on offer, although no wine list or drinks menu was offered on the outbound leg. The onboard 'chef' asked me what my choice of drinks would be, and deliberately knowing they would not have it, I asked for a Manhattan. He was so apologetic, but we laughed about it, and settled for a tripple Chevas on the rocks. He took my order a for Middle Eastern selection of starters, including humus and delicious concoctions. That was followed by a grilled steak that was so tender and tasty. The desert and cheese trolley followed soon after. The IFE as usual, is very limited, boring and the controls difficult to operate. The noise-cancelling headphones weren't any better, and kept crackling and I tried to watch a movie I had seen before, but had fallen asleep anyway, And hour and a half before landing, breakfast was served, I was too full and settled for just a croissant and coffee. On my return, I was served with a wine list and the onboard chef addressed me by name and even posed for some photos. The food was excellent, with very quick and friendly service from the flight attendants. Gulf Air in my view deserves to be upgraded to 4 stars, at least in Business Class.

Gulf Air usually use A330's on their long haul sectors, but for some reason deploy a narrow body for this one mid week flight. The 2x2 layout for the A320ER was as expected. But what surprised me was the seat pitch of around 76 inches, three clear windows width, and partition for privacy, which was the same as wide body aircraft. On boarding I was offered a hot towel and a welcome drink, including sparkling wine. The amenity kit was OK without being luxurious. We took off on time, and I settled down in my seat which was very comfortable and big. Then came the on board 'chef' (like on Turkish Airlines), taking my request for lunch. Pre lunch drinks were served, with top ups, followed by an excellent meal. Their signature dish of tender Lamb Shank was oh so delicious, followed by a sweet and cheese trolley. My only disappointment was the IFE, with a very limited selection of movies and shows. I opted to read my book and nodded off for a short nap instead. An hour before landing, we were served with a snack. Arriving in Bahrain usually meets with hectic queues. No Fast Track was offered. But I was pleasantly surprised to be second in the queue at passport control. From disembarking, to meeting my contact at arrivals in a mere 15 minutes! It was a faultless flight (with the exception of IFE), with good service and great food. I am looking forward to my next leg on a A330.",Business,4.0,nan

Upon returning to the airport at 1100pm on New Year's eve, I was told the flight was cancelled. There was no business Check in, so wth two kids I had to wait in a long queue of irate passengers. They were massively under-staffed, and were unable to find me any alternative flight to London, so I booked my own - on Qatar Airways (a great airline) - it took my a whole 3 minutes to find this flight, but Gulf air were unable to do anything! Despite writing three times to Gulf, including one email to the mis-titled, 'director of communications', I had no apology or indeed any reply whatsoever from them. Eventually through my on line travel agency I got a note saying that I would be reimbursed for my flight within 30 Days. It is all a bit of a joke, my last minute tickets on Qatar Airways cost me an additional £3,000. So if this is how they treat their Business Class customers, imagine what it's like in Economy. I seriously recommend never using Gulf - there is a massive Gulf between what they promise and what they deliver! ",Family Leisure,1.0,nan

Checked into the lounge for a few hours' sleep only to realise that the flight had been delayed by three hours, which really worried me seeing as I had a 3 hour layover in Bahrain. But, waited out and then after another delay (there was no explanation by the way) boarded an old A320 with poorly maintained seats, broken IFE and an absolute skirmish for seats. Taking the seat on your boarding pass? Forget about it. I'm glad I actually got a seat if I'm honest. Breakfast was positively repulsive judging by what my brother got so I skipped on it. Cabin crew were curt and disrespectful. Got to Bahrain and my connection to London had been delayed by 8 hours, giving me 5 hours in Bahrain airport. Went to try and talk to someone at a counter about the status of the next flight and all I got was an earful of shouts and insults. McDonalds in Bahrain is pretty cheap and is fairly low on the Big Mac index. Heathrow flight was OK – pretty empty, crew was pleasant and food not as terrible. IFE semi worked. Plane was still very old and the seat was pretty uncomfortable. I bought these tickets as they were cheap via a travel agent. The extra £100 to fly with Qatar Airways would have been so worth it.

We were given an option of flying straight to Dubai then onto Frankfurt (had to make our own way to Paris) Or take the same flight on the 19th Jan. Now blocked at passport control! Even though we had the 'vouchers' from Gulf - they wouldn't let us enter Bahrain. After hours of back and forth we arrived at a hotel at 5am. Flight 19th Jan - 11pm I tried to speak to the customer services at check in - they had no interest in helping me find an address to make a claim. Only to be told the flight was now leaving early to fly via Cairo and arriving 2 hours late. My seat was 24C last row aisle, upon boarding I was told it wasn't available and to take any other seat. It also seemed they had told people to take any seat. It was pandemonium. After being more that 24 hours delayed I have missed all my train connections (had to by a new ticket). I can safely say I will never ever use Gulf Air. ",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,January 2018,4.0,1.0,4.0,no,Bangkok to Kuwait via Bahrain,3.0," |  Bangkok to Kuwait via Bahrain. I will never fly Gulf Air again. Pity. Convenient service, very favourable price, on-board customer service always excellent. Total contrast to the ground staff. New Year’s Eve 2017/18. Diverted flight to DXB instead of BAH, then from DXB to BAH and then from BAH to KWI. Worst customer experience I and others who spoke with have ever had. GA turned a minor problem (fog, inevitable delays) into 24 hour nightmare - no doubt longer for some customers less lucky than me. At DXB for about 11 hours. No update issued the entire time. But that experience was mild compared to when we arrived at BAH. Staff totally unresponsive to and contemptuous of their customers, who had serious and legitimate needs, questions. Instead of trying to help, GA staff seemed to take pleasure in making customers’ waiting experience as painful and lengthy as possible. After I lined up for over 6 hours near Gate 13, some staff manning the cues suddenly walked off. Promised to return but never did. One senior GA staff member angrily yelled at the crowd that it was their fault that they were waiting so long because they could not cue in 1 line. He told remaining staff to leave. No reason given. Eventually no one left to serve the customers. Told to go to the transfer area to be served. Went from terrible to much worse. About 15 customer cues, area totally crowded. After 2 hours, some staff again just left, didn’t return. So some cues had no staff. So cues soon turned into an unruly mob pushing and shoving, all pleading to be served. Instead of putting on more staff, GA operated understaffed, but not overworked! All staff at all times were visibly very calm, very relaxed, working very slowly, and also amused to be observing the pleas of the distressed crowd. They thought it was all a joke. There were up to 6 -8 other staff just monitoring the crowds from the front with a contemptuous smile. They could have helped out the lines that had no staff member, but didn’t bother to. Totally ignrored customer requests for assistance. One desperate elderly customer showed me his chest bandages and asked me to hand his passport details to the staff member. He was too weak to fight the pushing crowd. I was by this stage close to being served. I shamefully didn’t help the old man. I was fearful that handing another person’s documents could get me in trouble with the staff & delay the time I would be served. As it happened, as soon as I was given my new boarding pass, I was instructed to go immediately to the gate as they were departing. No baggage ref. number given to me. 5 minutes later and I would have missed that flight & not know when able to get another. It was survival of the fittest at this stage. The above situation was one that the management and ground staff created. They treated their customers like animals. Like a large herd of cattle. People were in distress. Responses to customer requests (if at all) with mindless answers like ‘just wait’ & bored smirk. I thought that the lack of oxygen, water & endless standing could cause me to pass out. I hung on because the alternative was worse – not knowing when I would leave BAH. The experience was so ugly that I refuse to use them again for moral & practical reasons.  PS. don’t even have luggage back yet. Whether I get it back or not, so relieved to escape nightmare. Space limit precludes further details.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan
