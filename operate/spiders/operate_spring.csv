A320,Premium Economy,5.0,February 2018,4.0,5.0,nan,yes,Nagoya to Shanghai,3.0," |  Nagoya to Shanghai in premium economy. Spring is a low cost carrier but Spring Plus (their premium economy offering) was far better than expected for the price. Spring Plus was the first 2 rows of economy with some extra leg room, priority baggae, food, drinks (including alcohol), a pillow and few other basics. We had pre-purchased 90kg of luggage between the two of us and had no issues with checking in 4 large bags. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience of this flight. Crew were friendly and polite and the food was decent. Boarding was on-time and departure/arrival was also close to schedule. Arrival at PVG is at a remote stand with a bus to terminal but for the price, it's nothing to worry about. No complaints, and would happily fly Spring airlines in their Spring Plus cabin again.",Couple Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,October 2017,nan,2.0,nan,no,Bangkok to Shanghai,1.0," |  Bangkok to Shanghai. Terrible experience. The cabin crew is unpolite. Also passengers do not follow rules for cell phones switch off or seatbelts turned on. Seats can not recline and there is almost no legspace. They are cramping as many sears in a small space as possible. Continuously prerecorded announcements about tax fee items, and many rules which are played very loud. Due to no meal service all people brought their burger king meals onboard making the whole plane smell like a fast food restaurant and huge garbage place as passengers just throw rubbish on the floor. Again because of zero service also no rubbish collection. In short, worst airline ever and not recommended. Better spend a couple of euro more and feel relaxed.",Couple Leisure,1.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,2.0,September 2017,nan,1.0,1.0,no,Shanghai to Shenzhen,1.0," |  Worst airline I have ever taken! When going to the gate entrance they told me that my luggage size was too large! I have a standard Samsonite hand carry luggage incl full loaded weight 6kg. Spring Airlines luggage can only be 30cm high and width. Had to pay to check in my hand carry luggage. The gates in Shanghai are separate from all other gates, no eateries or anything. You have no leg space. If you are on a low budget, have no luggage except a handbag and feel fine with low class service and are flexible enough to put your legs in your neck you can consider this airline.",Solo Leisure,2.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,February 2017,nan,4.0,nan,yes,Shenzhen to Hangzhou,3.0," |  Shenzhen to Hangzhou. Best value for money. As the first low-cost airline company, Spring offers you the best prices (usually) for domestic flights. I booked this one-way flight in early February for 350RMB, cheaper than both trains and bullet trains for the same place of departure and destination (from Shenzhen to Hangzhou). Perhaps because it's an early flight taking off at 6:20 am, the cabin was really quiet the whole trip. And there wasn't any promotion of products by the cabin staff as many complained about, nor did the stewardess teach us to do some stretches. But the luggage limits are a little tight, only a bag of 7 kilograms on board and without any free check-in luggage. So you'd better book your check-in luggage online and pay for it, otherwise it will cost you more in the airport. You don't have much legroom since Spring aircrafts often have 180 seats (other airline companies always have 150 seats for the same type). And for the economy class, there weren't any free meals or drinks which you have to buy on board. All in all, you shouldn't miss Spring Airlines if you do not have lots of baggage and want to save tons of money.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,January 2017,nan,1.0,nan,no,Shanghai to Bangkok,1.0," |  Shanghai to Bangkok. This was a truly awful experience. The behaviour of the other passengers and lack of authority/support from the flight crew was astonishing. The family in the seat behind me had two children who kicked the back of my seat the entire flight, the duty free sales pitch over the tannoy went on for over twenty minutes, three hours into the flight someone smoked a cigarette in the toilet, the fasten seat belt signs were totally ignored and during the descent (literally 200m above the runway) passengers got up to retrieve their bags leaving the overhead locker doors open during landing. The antisocial behaviour was truly unbelievable and the cabin crews letting any of it happen was equally unbelievable. I will not use an airline that takes rules and safety so lightly again. It was like an exercise in how not to conduct an international flight. Not to mention the hour long queue and ensuing rugby scrum to check in. Utter chaos.",Solo Leisure,4.0,nan
A320,Economy Class,4.0,December 2016,4.0,4.0,nan,yes,PVG to HKG,2.0," |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. Spring Airlines is a budget LCC and there is no question about that. But I think for an LCC, it is about as good as it gets. There was little to no line at the check in counters, and boarding was quick and efficient. I did not find the staff to be rude. Yes they are strict with the baggage but even regular airlines can be like that these days. The seats are definitely cramped, even if you have a spring plus, but you are saving a ton of money by flying this airline. A few points I'd make: -If possible definitely buy a spring plus ticket. It is not that much more, but you get extra legroom, a special check in line (at Shanghai), a full meal, drinks, priority boarding etc. -They don't allow use of mobile phones in flight. Even in airplane mode. Bring your ipad or computer because they will allow these. Very strange policy. -At some point in the flight one of the CAs will give a 20 minute speech to everyone about all the in flight shopping products they have. You really need some earplugs for this part. Because this is an LCC, the main drawback is that there is no guarantee you will get to your destination. If something goes wrong with the plane, weather, or airport, you could be delayed 12 hours or just have your flight cancelled with no extra help. That's the risk you take with this type of airline.",Solo Leisure,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,November 2016,nan,1.0,nan,no,BKK to PVG,1.0," |  Bangkok to Shanghai. The worst airline ever. Yes it is a budget airline but for an international flight you can only get 15kg, that is including the 5kg Hand luggage.  So in other words your allowance is 5kg handluggage and 10 kg checked in luggage. The staff are most unfriendly. You don't even get water for the 4,5 hour flight but paid almost 200 Euros for one way, so it's not that cheap.  If you want to book an international flight try AirAsia, Thai Smile, Nok Airways or other alternatives. I will never book with Spring Airlines again for an international flight.",Solo Leisure,1.0,nan

From Shanghai back to Hong Kong, boarding was delayed for more than 1 hour without any explanation. Then we waited on the tarmac for 1 hour before they told us that we weren't going to take off for another hour. Didn't they know that before we boarded? Or is that a way to sell their disgusting food on board? All this happened after they canceled the flight I was supposed to take and left me with no choice but this flight. Total waste of time, you should absolutely avoid this company, it is not even worth the money. Or take it only if you have absolutely nothing else planned during the day.",Business,1.0,nan

Delayed on the tarmac for over an hour. Flight landed well and took off safely which was a plus. However, few food and beverage choices and reading and entertainment were absolutely horrible for a flight of only 2 and a half hours, seemed like I was on board for 7 hours. The staff do not allow you to use your phone at all, not even at cruising altitude which does not allow me to read from my phone. Conclusion - only fly this airline if it's a short trip or outrageously cheap.

A340,Business Class,4.0,May 2016,4.0,5.0,nan,yes,PVG to SJW,1.0," |  This a budget airline. For those who have high expectations and then are disappointed, well you should expect that they will nickel and dime you for extra luggage, as all the discount airlines do. Thanks to all the reviews on this site, I was prepared for Spring Airlines. I specifically bought the ""Business Class"" ticket, also known as SpringPlus, which allows a generous 25kg. Reading the fine print, that 25kg includes 7kg in the carry-on, that you should not exceed (in practice they did not weigh my carry on, as it was just a backpack). Thus after booking my ticket and buying a lot of things in Shanghai I went online (all in English) and added an extra 10kg a few days before my flight so that my 25kg suitcase would have no problems with my new 35kg total limit. I also knew that it was the May holiday, and specifically booked a daytime flight a day before everyone would be returning. This was to ensure: 1) less delays, (and I experienced none), and 2) services would be available if something went wrong (easier when ground staff are on their daytime shift, easier to get a taxi when landing, etc). The first two rows are considered ""business"". In reality the seats don't recline, and while the first row has good legroom, the second row is pretty much economy, and after 2 hours I felt more tired than I did on 11 hours of Cathay Pacific Economy. Leg room practically zero - second class high speed trains in China have more legroom. If you are a bigger guy you really need the first row. The service is good on SpringPlus though - special red carpet check-in - they wrap your luggage (really unnecessary), provide a special shuttle bus to plane, priority boarding, etc. But the seat is just hard. Throughout the flight they manage to do a large amount of sales, the lady with the microphone started advertising electric razors, some model airplanes and other things (all in Chinese of course). I suppose they make some good money off these aggressive sales. Would I fly them again? Sure if I had to. My other option if not flying would be a 7+ hour trip (a 5 hour train to Beijing, and then a taxi to another train station and then another 1.5 hours by high speed train). Or I could fly 2 hours (+2 hours arriving early) direct with Spring. So I chose that. Other notes: 1) Unless you only have a backpack, I recommend SpringPlus if you have a lot of, or just ANY luggage, and recommend buying more than required (add on option on website, during purchase and anytime after as well) - better to have 10kg extra and lose it than to get charged a ridiculous price at the airport. 2) I'm fluent in Mandarin, so had a much easier time. If you don't speak the language and are traveling domestically in China (e.g. Chinese city to Chinese city, and not to another country) you might have a lot of issues as no staff members speak English and neither do the passengers who could potentially help you. 3) Book a day flight to provide better visibility and hopefully less delays 4) Don't expect to rest/sleep on the flight. It should only be a few hours anyway.

Buy your drink and food before as they will run out of supplies. The big problem for me was communication the flight attendant was unaware of air plane mode on my iphone and continuously asked me to turn off my mobile phone.

It is listed in the fine print somewhere but not advertised.  The charge is approximately $10 USD/KG over the limit. Online excess baggage is impossible to do unless you read and speak Mandarin, have Ali-Pay and pay two days in advance. Forget calling because they refused to take my credit card (Visa). I made a spelling mistake in my last name on the online ticket from Bangkok to Shanghai Pudong (admittedly my mistake) but Spring Airlines advertises that you can change the mistake for a small fee. This was a nice surprise, the problem - you have to do it at the Spring Airlines reservation counter and there is no reservation counter in Bangkok where I was. So I had to purchase another ticket. But in the end, it was way cheaper for me to purchase a second ticket on a different airline than it was to pay for extra baggage on Spring Airlines. Even though the second ticket was twice the price I paid for the Spring Airlines ticket, it was still worked out to be cheaper. My second ticket had a baggage allowance of 2 bags (23kg each) + 10kg carry-on like most normal carriers. With Spring Airlines I would have cost me $410USD for the bags alone. So I kissed my girlfriend goodbye and flew alone with all of our bags and she flew Spring Airlines with little more than her carry-on luggage. The staff was also not friendly at all at the check-in counter but understandably so. They were subject to arguing with most of the passengers when they pointed out the reality of the ticket and baggage limitations.

The flight was on time but it took ages for everyone to board the plane because our aircraft was parked at a remote stand. No one expects the comfort of full service airlines on a low cost carrier, the legroom was ridiculously small and there was no onboard service at all. They didnt even provide any food/drinks for sale. As an aviation lover, I tried to film the take off, but later on the cabin crews shouted at me, and ask me switch off my phone, not even in flight mode. They kept advertising some sort of useless things, didnt even allow me to rest onboard the plane. It was disappointing. I would never choose to fly with them again.",Family Leisure,2.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,5.0,nan,nan,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,We flew Shanghai Pudong - Hong Kong March 2015. This is most definitely a budget airline expect little and you (probably) won't be disappointed. We booked with Spring Airlines as their fares were the cheapest. Our flight to Hong Kong was delayed by a couple of hours. We didn't know the departure gate until it was boarding which was a bit annoying but not a big deal. Because we then arrived so late we had to get a taxi which wasn't the cheapest. We received an email the next day which was in Chinese. Considering you can book on the English section of the website with no problems it's a little odd that they only email you in Chinese I asked a friend to translate the email for me - luckily as it was informing us of the cancellation of our return flight. I was able to rebook by ringing their hotline with no difficulty and the woman I spoke to had excellent English. Our flight back to Shanghai was something of a nightmare - initially delayed by 2.5 hours we then ended up sitting on the tarmac for 6.5 hours with very little idea of when we might actually take off. The problem was fog in Shanghai but rather than diverting or canceling the flight (or letting everyone wait in the terminal) we were kept on board that whole time. This was overnight instead of arriving at 10pm we arrived at 7am. The fog was obviously not the fault of the airline but the delay wasn't handled well resulting in a lot of very angry passengers. I must say though that the flight attendants were so calm and courteous throughout the ordeal despite what they were having to deal with. They were excellent. We were given water and biscuits during the wait. I don't think I would fly with Spring Airlines again - we really did have a lot more hassle and it would have been worth paying a bit more for a better experience.,nan,3.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,1.0,no,nan,4.0,Flight 8947 Sep 29 SHA-XIY. Please ensure your departure airport before leaving for your flight! Our flight was supposed to be leaving from Hongquiao Shanghai airport instead of Pudong Shanghai. Spring Airlines changed airport without any prior notifications. Luckily we were at the airport early and had just enough time to take the taxi to Pudong. Not a very pleasant experience to not be able to find your flight on the digital screen board and having to constantly checking your watch while taking a taxi to the actual departing airport. This is compounded by the fact that we don't speak Chinese. On the positive side I have no complaints regarding the actual flight and professionalism of the flight attendants.,nan,4.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,3.0,nan,nan,yes,nan,4.0,Wuhan - Osaka and back - the only direct flight from Wuhan to Japan. Was pleasantly surprised was expecting delays 2hrs+ from the other reviews both flights on time. Bought the in-cabin meal for 40RMB pork and rice dish portions were large what it lacks in quality it makes up in quantity. Staff was respectful and courteous traits which unfortunately some of my fellow passengers lacked. It appears that this flight is the go-to for large tour groups traveling from the central China region to Japan. 4 such groups were on my flight to Osaka and 2 on my flight back. Loud pushy rude. No inflight entertainment but what do you expect for a 3 hr flight and $200 a pop compared to other flights at $700 and up. Seat is comfortable enough if you are of short stature. Will use them again for future trips to Japan.,nan,5.0,nan
nan,Economy Class,1.0,nan,nan,nan,1.0,no,nan,3.0,Currently still waiting for the flight at Hong Kong Airport. 5 hours and still counting. Can't blame the airlines 100% since the delay is due to military exercise in China (according to the news I googled while waiting) but their service is poor. No ground staff. My flight was supposed to leave HK at 21.20 to Shanghai and now is already 2am and yet no confirmation on gate number or departure time. No information about the delay no hotel provided no food or drinks given not even a confirmed departure time.,nan,nan,nan
nan,Economy Class,4.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,yes,nan,3.0,Shenzhen-Shanghai Hongqiao. I was pleasantly surprised by Spring Airlines. The website was attractive easy to use and the English section was in very good English (unlike many other websites for Chinese airlines). Possibly I should regard myself as lucky to have only to had a 15-minute delay. The seats were comfortable enough for a 2.5 hour flight and I didn't care that there was no food. The plane was new and clean and the cabin crew were pleasant enough. I quite liked that they showed us some stretching exercises towards the end of the flight.,nan,4.0,nan
